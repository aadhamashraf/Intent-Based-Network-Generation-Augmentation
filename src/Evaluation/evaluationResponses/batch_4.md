| 35 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 119 processing cores and 101GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | The parameters are valid for NFV, but "modify core network" is ambiguous as it doesn't specify the Network Function being modified. | 3 | It specifies exact compute resources and a high-level goal, which is moderately complex. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between the compute resource change and "transport network optimization" could be more explicit. | 5 | The "Modify" action aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The link between modifying core compute resources and optimizing the transport network is plausible but not clearly detailed. | 5 | The specified compute resource values are consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the target Network Function is not identified. | 4.0 | A decent intent that suffers from a lack of specificity about the target of the modification. |

While a 256-bit NEA1 is not explicitly defined in the same way as 128-bit variants, 256-bit AES is a standard cipher, making this plausible for future specs. | 3 | Specifies multiple alert triggers (auth failure, security breach) and a separate notification for key rotation events. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but structuring the key rotation notification as a subordinate clause ("with...") is slightly confusing. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events is a clear notification request. | 4 | The primary alerts are coherent. Adding key rotation *events* as a notification is also valid but could be stated as a separate rule for clarity. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are consistent with the 5G security framework. | 4 | The intent is clear on triggers but lacks detail on notification channels or content. | 4.3 | A good, security-focused notification intent that could be phrased a bit more clearly. |

Alerting on failures is a standard security operation. | 3 | It specifies multiple, distinct trigger conditions for alerts and notifications. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the phrasing "with 9hours key rotation event notifications" could be interpreted as a condition rather than a separate notification rule. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific failures is a clear notification request. | 4 | The alert conditions are coherent. Adding key rotation notifications is also coherent but could be stated more clearly as a separate item. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are a valid and consistent combination. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers but not the notification channel or severity. | 4.3 | A good, security-oriented notification intent that could benefit from slightly clearer phrasing. |

This is more of a method statement than a performance goal. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a sophisticated, multi-objective optimization methodology. | 2 | The description is highly redundant and awkwardly phrased, which significantly harms readability. | 3 | While optimization is part of assurance, this intent describes *how* to optimize rather than *what* performance to assure.

ARM64 is a common architecture in modern data centers and edge devices, making this a relevant and valid feasibility check. | 3 | Specifies detailed compute parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) for a specific NF. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and easy to understand. | 5 | "Assess... feasibility" perfectly aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The request to check AMF feasibility on the ARM64 architecture is a coherent and practical task. | 5 | The specified parameters (cores, architecture, speed) are consistent for defining a compute node. | 4 | The intent is complete for a CPU-focused feasibility check, though memory would also be a key factor. | 4.6 | An excellent, practical intent to evaluate the deployment of a 5G NF on the ARM architecture. |
| 68 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 6hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | Certificate-based authentication and 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G) are standard 3GPP security mechanisms. Alerting on failures is a standard operational task. | 3 | Specifies multiple alert triggers and a separate notification for key rotation events. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but structuring the key rotation notification as a subordinate clause ("with...") is slightly confusing. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" failures fits the notification intent type perfectly. | 4 | The primary alerts are coherent. Adding key rotation events as a notification is also valid but could be stated as a separate rule for clarity. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are a consistent and valid combination. | 4 | The intent is clear on triggers but lacks detail on notification channels or content. | 4.3 | A good, security-focused notification intent that could be phrased a bit more clearly. |
| 69 | Deployment Intent | "Secure high-performance communications using ENABLED SUPI concealment mechanisms and 128_NEA1 encryption protocols, maintaining security without compromising performance characteristics." | 5 | SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier) concealment is a key privacy feature in 5G (TS 33.501). 128-NEA1 (AES) is a standard encryption algorithm. This is a perfectly valid security configuration for deployment. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, distinct security mechanisms (privacy/concealment and confidentiality/encryption) along with a performance constraint. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, technically precise, and easy to understand. | 5 | Applying security measures at deployment time is a core part of this intent type. | 5 | The combination of SUPI concealment for privacy and NEA1 for encryption is a coherent, multi-layered security strategy. | 5 | Both SUPI concealment and 128-NEA1 are standard, consistent parts of the 5G security architecture. | 5 | The intent completely specifies the required security posture for the deployment. | 4.9 | An excellent intent that correctly identifies and applies specific, important 5G security and privacy features. |
| 70 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 59 core utilization and 99GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This is a standard and valid request for performance analysis of the AMF in a 5G core network. | 3 | The request for analysis and recommendations makes it more complex than just reporting raw data. | 5 | The intent is phrased clearly, is specific, and uses standard terminology. | 5 | "Generate... report" perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The request to analyze usage patterns to provide optimization recommendations is a logical and coherent workflow. | 5 | The metrics are standard for NFV performance analysis and are consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the target NF, the metrics, and the desired output. | 4.7 | Another perfect example of a clear, actionable, and well-formed reporting intent. |
| 71 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 80 processing cores and 196GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | While the parameters are valid for NFV, "modify core network" is ambiguous as it doesn't specify which NF or slice is being modified. | 3 | It specifies exact compute resources and a high-level goal, which is moderately complex. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between modifying compute resources and "transport network optimization" is not explicit. | 5 | The "Modify" action aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The link between modifying core compute resources and optimizing the transport network is plausible but not clearly detailed. | 5 | The specified compute resource values are consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the target Network Function is not identified. | 4.0 | A decent intent that suffers from a lack of specificity about the target of the modification. |
| 72 | Deployment Intent | "Monitor security events using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with 3minutes/10minutes/60minutes escalation policies, ensuring rapid response to security incidents." | 4 | Isolation Forest is a standard anomaly detection algorithm. Using it for security monitoring is a valid application. This feels more like a "Performance Assurance" or "Notification" intent than "Deployment". | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the detection algorithm and a multi-tier escalation policy. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and easy to understand. | 3 | The intent describes an ongoing monitoring activity ("Monitor security events"), which is typically configured post-deployment. It's not deploying an infrastructure itself. | 5 | The use of an anomaly detection model with a defined escalation policy is a coherent strategy for security monitoring. | 5 | The specified components are consistent and work together to define a security response plan. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the detection method and the full escalation timeline. | 4.4 | A very good intent for setting up a security monitoring process, but it is slightly miscategorized as a "Deployment Intent". |
| 73 | Deployment Intent | "Instantiate production-ready High_Performance_Compute_Optimized configuration utilizing Kubernetes container orchestration with mission-critical Airflow workflow automation, providing seamless lifecycle management and automated scaling capabilities." | 5 | Kubernetes is the de facto standard for container orchestration. Airflow is a standard workflow automation tool. "Flavor"-like configurations are common. The intent describes a modern cloud-native deployment. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the configuration profile, the orchestration platform (Kubernetes), the automation engine (Airflow), and the desired operational characteristics (lifecycle management, auto-scaling). | 5 | The intent is clearly written, technically rich, and uses standard cloud-native terminology correctly. | 5 | "Instantiate... configuration" is a clear deployment action. | 5 | The use of Kubernetes for orchestration and Airflow for workflow automation is a coherent and common pattern for deploying and managing cloud-native applications. | 5 | All the specified technologies are consistent and complementary in a modern CI/CD and operational environment. | 4 | The intent is complete in describing the 'how' (tools and platforms) but not the 'what' (the actual application or NF to be deployed). | 4.9 | An excellent intent that accurately captures the process of deploying a cloud-native network function using modern DevOps tools. |
| 74 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 13hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-AKA' is standard. A 256-bit NEA2 is plausible for high security. Alerting on these events is a valid security operation. | 3 | Specifies multiple, distinct trigger conditions for alerts and notifications. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the phrasing "with... key rotation event notifications" is slightly awkward and could be clearer. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" failures directly matches the notification intent type. | 4 | The alert conditions are coherent. Adding key rotation notifications is also coherent but could be stated more clearly as a separate rule. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are a valid and consistent combination. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers but not the notification channel or severity (beyond 'high-priority'). | 4.3 | A good, security-oriented notification intent that would benefit from slightly clearer phrasing. |
| 75 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 12hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is standard. A 256-bit NEA2 is plausible for high security. Alerting on these events is a valid security operation. | 3 | Specifies multiple, distinct trigger conditions for alerts and notifications. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the phrasing "with... key rotation event notifications" is slightly awkward and could be clearer. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" failures directly matches the notification intent type. | 4 | The alert conditions are coherent. Adding key rotation notifications is also coherent but could be stated more clearly as a separate rule. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are a valid and consistent combination. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers but not the notification channel or severity (beyond 'high-priority'). | 4.3 | A good, security-oriented notification intent that would benefit from slightly clearer phrasing. |
| 76 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 138469_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and EAP_AKA_Prime/128_NEA3 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 5 | Device density is a key performance indicator for mMTC in 5G. Analyzing the performance overhead of specific security protocols (EAP-AKA', 128-NEA3) is a critical and valid feasibility study. | 4 | This is a complex feasibility check, requiring analysis of the interplay between a scaling metric (device density) and the performance cost of security. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, specific, and technically precise. | 5 | The request to "Consider... impact" is a clear feasibility check. | 5 | The intent coherently links a scalability requirement (high density) with a performance analysis of the required security mechanisms. | 5 | The specified density and security protocols are consistent parameters for a 5G system analysis. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating what needs to be analyzed and in what context. | 4.9 | An excellent, highly relevant intent for assessing the performance trade-offs of security in a large-scale 5G deployment. |
| 77 | Deployment Intent | "Configure 5000ms performance averaging windows for 5QI_8_Video_TCP_Premium QoS flow management, providing consistent service quality and fair resource distribution." | 4 | 5QI (5G QoS Identifier) is a standard 3GPP concept, but 5QI 8 is for a GBR service and doesn't have a standardized name like "Video_TCP_Premium". The configuration of averaging windows is a plausible policy. This feels more like a Modification/Configuration intent. | 3 | It specifies a very specific QoS parameter (averaging window) for a specific traffic class, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and easy to understand. | 4 | While this is a configuration action, it's typically done post-deployment to tune performance, making it more of a modification than a greenfield deployment. | 5 | The intent coherently links a specific configuration parameter to the goals of service quality and fairness. | 5 | The parameters are internally consistent for a QoS policy configuration. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the parameter, its value, the context (5QI), and the goal. | 4.4 | A good, specific intent for QoS policy tuning, though it might be better classified as a Modification Intent. |
| 78 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 49 processing cores and 20GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | While the parameters are valid for NFV, "modify core network" is ambiguous as it doesn't specify which NF or slice is being modified. | 3 | It specifies exact compute resources and a high-level goal, which is moderately complex. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between modifying compute resources and "transport network optimization" is not explicit. | 5 | The "Modify" action aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The link between modifying core compute resources and optimizing the transport network is plausible but not clearly detailed. | 5 | The specified compute resource values are consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the target Network Function is not identified. | 4.0 | A decent intent that suffers from a lack of specificity about the target of the modification. |
| 79 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Establish comprehensive GOLD_TIER Service Level Agreement with mission-critical 99.99% availability guarantee and 99.9% reliability commitment, implementing research-grade sophisticated monitoring and automated remediation capabilities." | 5 | SLAs, availability, and reliability are standard concepts. The use of "research-grade sophisticated monitoring" is descriptive but points to a desire for advanced, non-standard capabilities. | 4 | This is a complex intent defining a high-level SLA with specific targets and requiring advanced, possibly experimental, operational capabilities. | 5 | The intent is well-structured and clear. | 5 | "Establish... Service Level Agreement" is a core performance assurance activity. | 5 | The intent coherently links the SLA tier, its specific metrics, and the advanced capabilities needed to support it. | 5 | The specified availability and reliability targets are consistent with a premium service. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing a full picture of the desired service level agreement and its operational support system. | 4.9 | An excellent, business-oriented intent that specifies a premium SLA and calls for cutting-edge assurance capabilities. |
| 80 | Deployment Intent | "Ensure 99.949% service availability through MAY_PREEMPT preemption capabilities and priority-based resource allocation, maintaining performance guarantees for critical services." | 5 | Service availability is a standard metric. `MAY_PREEMPT` is a standardized pre-emption capability in 3GPP TS 23.501, allowing a resource to be pre-empted by higher-priority ones. | 4 | This intent combines a specific SLA target with low-level resource management mechanisms (preemption, priority). | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, with a logical flow from the high-level goal to the mechanisms used to achieve it. | 4 | Similar to record 14, the primary action "Ensure" sounds like assurance, but these constraints are typically set at deployment time. | 5 | The intent coherently links the availability target to the mechanisms (preemption, priority allocation) required to enforce it. | 5 | Using `MAY_PREEMPT` is consistent with managing a pool of resources where some services can be displaced for more critical ones. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the availability target and the key mechanisms to be used. | 4.7 | A strong intent that correctly uses 3GPP QoS terminology to define service guarantees. |
| 81 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 85 processing cores and 76GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The specified parameters (cores, memory, timeout) are standard for NFV resource management. The focus on deterministic performance is key for 5G. | 4 | The intent balances multiple constraints (cores, memory, timeout) and objectives (deterministic performance, cost), making it a complex optimization task. | 4 | The sentence is dense with information but is logically structured. The quotes are unnecessary. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification action. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the resource adjustment to the dual goals of deterministic performance and cost efficiency. | 5 | All specified parameters are consistent and relevant for managing virtualized compute resources. | 5 | The intent provides specific, quantifiable values for all key parameters, making it complete and actionable. | 4.7 | A well-defined and practical intent for multi-objective resource management, with a correct emphasis on deterministic performance. |
| 82 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 21 RISC_V processing cores at 1.72GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G NF. RISC-V is an emerging open-standard ISA. Assessing feasibility for "deterministic performance" is a critical and valid check for uRLLC-supporting functions. | 3 | Specifies detailed compute parameters and a key performance constraint (deterministic), adding moderate complexity. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and easy to understand. | 5 | "Assess... feasibility" perfectly aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The request to check AMF feasibility on RISC-V with a focus on deterministic performance is a coherent and forward-looking task. | 5 | The specified parameters (cores, architecture, speed) are consistent for defining a compute node. | 4 | The intent is complete for a CPU-focused feasibility check, but memory would also be a critical factor for deterministic performance. | 4.6 | An excellent, forward-looking intent that combines emerging hardware with critical 5G performance requirements. |
| 83 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 188ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | While the goal (response time) is clear, "predictive analytics" and "automated remediation" are concepts, not specific 3GPP standards, though they align with the goals of NWDAF. | 3 | Specifies a target metric (response time) and the methods to achieve it, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The description is straightforward, clear, and easy to understand. | 5 | The intent to "Optimize performance" by achieving a specific metric is a classic example of performance assurance. | 5 | The goal (optimize performance), target (188ms), and methods (analytics, remediation) are logically connected. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions; the methods support the stated performance goal. | 4 | It provides a clear target but is less specific about *what* to optimize, leaving some ambiguity. | 4.4 | A good, goal-oriented performance intent that is clear and actionable at a high level. |
| 84 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Establish comprehensive SILVER_TIER Service Level Agreement with mission-critical 99.99% availability guarantee and 99.9% reliability commitment, implementing research-grade sophisticated monitoring and automated remediation capabilities." | 4 | The SLA components are standard. The combination of "SILVER_TIER" with a "mission-critical 99.99%" availability (typically a gold/platinum level) and "research-grade" monitoring is slightly inconsistent. | 4 | This is a complex intent defining an SLA with specific targets and requiring advanced, potentially experimental, operational capabilities. | 5 | The intent is well-structured and clear. | 5 | "Establish... Service Level Agreement" is a core performance assurance activity. | 5 | The intent coherently links the SLA tier, its metrics, and the advanced capabilities needed to support it. | 3 | There's an inconsistency between a mid-level "SILVER_TIER" and the very high availability target (99.99%) and advanced capabilities, which are usually reserved for premium tiers. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing a full picture of the desired service level agreement. | 4.4 | A well-formed intent that is slightly weakened by an inconsistency between the service tier name and its demanding requirements. |
| 85 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 19hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-TLS is a standard authentication framework. A 256-bit NEA2 is plausible for high security. Alerting on these events is a valid security operation. | 3 | Specifies multiple, distinct trigger conditions for alerts and notifications. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the phrasing "with... key rotation event notifications" is slightly awkward and could be clearer. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" failures directly matches the notification intent type. | 4 | The alert conditions are coherent. Adding key rotation notifications is also coherent but could be stated more clearly as a separate rule. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are a valid and consistent combination. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers but not the notification channel or severity. | 4.3 | A good, security-oriented notification intent that would benefit from slightly clearer phrasing. |
| 86 | Deployment Intent | Launch Airflow orchestration automation with mission-critical Terraform infrastructure-as-code achieving FULLY_AUTOMATED automation level for consistent deployments. | 5 | Airflow (workflow automation) and Terraform (Infrastructure-as-Code) are de facto industry standards for automated deployment in cloud environments. "FULLY_AUTOMATED" is a standard goal in automation maturity models. | 4 | This intent is complex, specifying the complete toolchain (Airflow, Terraform) and the target automation level. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, technically precise, and uses standard DevOps terminology correctly. | 5 | "Launch... orchestration automation" is a clear deployment-enabling action. | 5 | The use of Terraform for IaC managed by an Airflow workflow to achieve full automation is a perfectly coherent and modern deployment strategy. | 5 | Terraform and Airflow are complementary tools and are consistently used together in this manner. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the tools and the desired end-state of the automation process. | 4.9 | An excellent intent that describes the deployment of an automation platform using industry-standard tools and concepts. |
| 87 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with high-priority 30 x86_64 cores and 164GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Provisioning compute resources with specific CPU and memory (x86_64, DDR4) is a standard NFVI task. | 3 | The intent specifies the exact resource quantities and architecture, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | "Provision... compute resources" is a direct deployment action. | 5 | The intent coherently links the provisioning of resources to the purpose of supporting demanding network functions. | 5 | The specified resources (30 cores, 164GB DDR4) are a consistent and plausible server configuration. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying what to provision and in what quantities. | 4.7 | A perfect, straightforward intent for provisioning infrastructure resources. |
| 88 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 466GB DDR5 memory and 7796GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | DDR5 and NVMe PCIe 4.0 are standard high-performance hardware components. Evaluating their impact is a valid feasibility check. | 3 | The request for a performance impact analysis makes this more complex than a simple resource check. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and unambiguous. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The request to evaluate specific hardware with a performance impact analysis is a logical and coherent task. | 5 | The specified memory and storage types represent a plausible high-performance server configuration and are consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the hardware components and the type of analysis required. | 4.7 | A clear, practical, and well-defined intent for infrastructure planning. |
| 89 | Deployment Intent | "Secure multi-domain orchestration using fault-tolerant HMAC_SHA384 key derivation functions with mission-critical 256_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 6hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle." | 5 | HMAC-SHA384 is a standard cryptographic function. The described security practices are aligned with modern security principles for distributed systems like 5G. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying cryptographic algorithms, key size, and a dynamic rotation policy for a multi-domain environment. | 5 | The intent is well-written, clear, and technically precise. | 5 | The description outlines a security framework to be applied during deployment, making it a valid deployment intent. | 5 | The elements—securing orchestration, using specific crypto functions, and rotating keys—are coherently linked to maintain security. | 4 | Using HMAC-SHA384 (which has a 384-bit output) with "256_bit cryptographic keys" is a bit unusual but technically possible (the key is an input, not the output). A 384-bit key would be more typical. | 5 | The intent provides a complete specification for the security mechanism. | 4.9 | An excellent, security-focused deployment intent with specific and relevant technical details. |
| 90 | Modification Intent | "Adjust network high-capacity to 3212Mbps broadband allocation and 792522_devices_per_km2 connection density requirements, accommodating growing user demands and traffic patterns." | 5 | Broadband capacity (throughput) and connection density are standard performance indicators for 5G services (eMBB and mMTC, respectively). | 4 | This intent is complex as it requires modifying the network to meet two distinct and potentially conflicting performance targets. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and includes the justification for the change. | 5 | "Adjust network high-capacity" is a clear modification request. | 5 | The intent coherently links the need to adjust network parameters to specific traffic and density targets to meet user demand. | 5 | The specified throughput and connection density targets are consistent with the goals of a 5G network evolution. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing specific, measurable targets for the modification. | 4.9 | A very good, high-level intent that sets clear performance evolution targets for the network. |
| 91 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with mission-critical 1 x86_64 cores and 9GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Provisioning compute resources is a standard NFVI task. The specified resources are valid. | 3 | The intent specifies exact resource quantities, architecture, and memory type. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | "Provision... compute resources" is a direct deployment action. | 4 | The intent is coherent, but allocating only 1 core and 9GB of memory for "demanding network functions" seems low, raising a slight question about the practical logic. | 5 | The specified resources (1 core, 9GB DDR5) are technically consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying what to provision and in what quantities. | 4.6 | A well-formed intent, although the resource allocation seems small for the stated purpose, which is a minor logical issue. |
| 92 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade UPF network function using Nokia SW_1.7.424 software on high-performance 4-core x86_64 architecture with 13GB DDR4 memory and 432GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | UPF is a standard 5G NF. The intent describes a typical VNF/CNF deployment, specifying the vendor, software version, and the underlying hardware resources. This is highly realistic. | 5 | This is a very complex and detailed deployment intent, specifying software, hardware architecture, memory, and storage. | 5 | The intent is perfectly clear, well-structured, and contains all the necessary details for a deployment order. | 5 | "Deploy... UPF network function" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | All components of the description are coherently linked to define a complete UPF deployment package. | 5 | The specified hardware resources (4-core CPU, 13GB RAM, NVMe SSD) are a consistent and plausible configuration for a UPF instance. | 5 | The intent is exceptionally complete, leaving no ambiguity about what needs to be deployed. | 5.0 | A perfect, industry-grade example of a detailed and actionable deployment intent. |

| 94 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 53GB LPDDR5 memory and 4479GB Optane storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 5 | LPDDR5 (typically for mobile/edge) and Optane are standard hardware components. Evaluating their impact is a valid feasibility check. | 3 | The request for a "mission-critical" performance impact analysis adds complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and unambiguous. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The request to evaluate specific hardware with a performance impact analysis is a logical and coherent task. | 5 | The specified memory and storage types are consistent, representing a possible configuration for an edge or specialized compute node. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the hardware components and the type of analysis required. | 4.7 | A clear, practical, and well-defined intent for infrastructure planning. |
| 95 | Deployment Intent | "Ensure 100.000% service availability through SHALL_NOT_PREEMPT preemption capabilities and priority-based resource allocation, maintaining deterministic performance guarantees for critical services." | 5 | `SHALL_NOT_PREEMPT` is a standard 3GPP pre-emption capability (TS 23.501). The intent correctly links this to achieving high availability for critical services. `100.000%` is an ideal, not a technically achievable value, but is often used to express a requirement for no unplanned downtime. | 4 | This intent combines a high-level (and idealistic) SLA target with specific low-level resource management mechanisms, making it quite complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, with a logical flow from the high-level goal to the mechanisms used to achieve it. | 4 | The primary action is "Ensure," which sounds like assurance. However, these are often set at deployment time. The idealistic 100% target slightly lowers the practicality. | 5 | The intent coherently links the availability target to the mechanisms (non-preemption, priority allocation) required to enforce it. | 4 | The 100% availability target is theoretically inconsistent with reality, but the technical mechanisms are sound. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the availability target and the key mechanisms to be used. | 4.6 | A very strong intent that correctly uses 3GPP QoS terminology, though the 100% availability target is aspirational. |
| 96 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 69 ARM64 processing cores at 2.79GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G NF. ARM64 is a common architecture, making this a relevant and valid feasibility check. | 3 | Specifies detailed compute parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) for a specific NF. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and easy to understand. | 5 | "Assess... feasibility" perfectly aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The request to check AMF feasibility on the ARM64 architecture is a coherent and practical task. | 5 | The specified parameters (cores, architecture, speed) are consistent for defining a compute node. | 4 | The intent is complete for a CPU-focused feasibility check, though memory would also be a key factor. | 4.6 | An excellent, practical intent to evaluate the deployment of a 5G NF on the ARM architecture. |
| 97 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 613Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with 79.8ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 4 | Bitrate and latency are standard performance metrics. "Ultra-low latency" is typically associated with <10ms, so 79.8ms is more accurately just "low latency". | 4 | This is a complex check requiring network-wide analysis (topology, traffic patterns) against two performance constraints. | 5 | The intent is clear, well-structured, and technically specific. | 5 | "Analyze... feasibility" is a clear match for the intent type. | 5 | The request to analyze the feasibility of meeting bitrate and latency goals based on topology and traffic is a coherent and standard network planning task. | 4 | The combination of a high bitrate and a 79.8ms latency is plausible, but calling the latency "ultra-low" is a minor terminological inconsistency. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the metrics to be analyzed and the context for the analysis. | 4.6 | A very good and practical intent for network performance planning, with a minor issue in terminology. |
| 98 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 9hours automated key management. | 5 | 5G-AKA is standard.

A 279ms PDB is very high and does not align well with "mission-critical" which usually implies low latency. | 4 | This intent specifies multiple, precise QoS parameters and requires sophisticated implementation, making it complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and technically specific. | 5 | Configuring QoS parameters to assure quality is a core performance assurance task. | 4 | The intent structure is coherent, linking parameters to implementation mechanisms. | 3 | There is an inconsistency between the "mission-critical" qualifier and the very loose 279ms PDB.

| 168 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 60 processing cores and 74GB memory allocation with high-priority 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The parameters are standard for NFV resource management. The performance vs. cost optimization goal is a typical driver for such intents. | 4 | The intent balances multiple constraints (cores, memory, timeout) and objectives (performance, cost), making it a complex optimization task. | 4 | The sentence is dense with information but is logically structured. The superfluous quotes slightly reduce readability. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification action. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the resource adjustment to the dual goals of performance optimization and cost efficiency. | 5 | All specified parameters are consistent and relevant for managing virtualized compute resources. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing specific, quantifiable values, making it complete and actionable. | 4.7 | A well-defined and practical intent for multi-objective resource management. |

| 172 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization with mission-critical genetic algorithms for complex deterministic performance trade-off management. | 3 | Genetic algorithms are a known optimization technique. The phrasing is highly redundant. This is more of a method statement than a performance goal. The focus on "deterministic performance" is good, however. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a sophisticated, multi-objective optimization methodology for deterministic performance. | 2 | The description is highly redundant and awkwardly phrased ("multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization"), which significantly harms readability. | 3 | While optimization is part of assurance, this intent describes *how* to optimize rather than *what* performance to assure. It's borderline between a modification and an assurance intent. | 3 | The concept is coherent, but the repetitive language makes it seem poorly constructed. | 5 | The terms are consistent within the domain of optimization algorithms. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it specifies the algorithm but not the performance objectives or trade-offs to be managed. | 3.3 | A conceptually interesting but poorly written intent that is too vague to be actionable. The redundancy is a major flaw. |
