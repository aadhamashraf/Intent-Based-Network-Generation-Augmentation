| 1 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy cloud-native enhanced mobile broadband with high-priority high-high-throughput data services using Istio service mesh architecture, enabling microservices communication and advanced traffic management capabilities." | 4 | eMBB is a standard 3GPP use case, and a cloud-native microservices architecture aligns with the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). Istio is a valid non-3GPP implementation choice for an SBA service mesh. | 4 | The intent combines multiple technical domains: 5G services (eMBB), cloud-native architecture, and specific service mesh technology (Istio). | 4 | The description is clear and well-structured, though the phrase "high-high-throughput" is slightly awkward and redundant. | 5 | The description directly maps to a deployment action for a specific 5G service, aligning perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, stating the goal (deploy eMBB), the method (Istio), and the purpose (microservices communication). | 4 | The concepts are internally consistent, but the "high-high-throughput" repetition is a minor inconsistency in phrasing. | 4 | The intent is quite complete, specifying service type, priority, and architecture, but lacks specific slice parameters like S-NSSAI. | 4.3 | A strong, relevant deployment intent that clearly articulates a modern architectural approach, despite minor awkward phrasing. |
| 2 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with high-priority 13hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | All specified technologies (5G_AKA, 128-NEA3 for ZUC) are correct and standard 3GPP security mechanisms as per TS 33.501. | 3 | The intent specifies standard security events and parameters, showing a moderate level of technical detail. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and easily parsable for an automation system or a human operator. | 5 | This is a classic example of a notification request, specifying conditions for an alert, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The request is structured logically: condition (auth failure/breach), priority, and a related event notification. | 4 | Alerting on failures/breaches is consistent. Linking a key rotation notification is logical but could be a separate action; however, it doesn't create a contradiction. | 4 | The intent specifies the events to monitor and priority. It could be more complete by defining the notification channel or recipient. | 4.4 | An excellent, standards-aligned notification intent that is clear, specific, and actionable. |
| 3 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_TLS authentication frameworks and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-803-7807] | 2 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication framework. However, `256_NEA2` is non-standard; 3GPP-defined NEA algorithms (e.g., 128-NEA2 for SNOW 3G) are 128-bit. This is a significant terminology error. | 3 | The intent names specific security protocols, indicating a moderate level of technical detail. | 5 | The sentence is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand, despite the technical inaccuracy. | 5 | The intent focuses on securing infrastructure while maintaining performance, which is a core goal of performance assurance. | 5 | The structure is logical: goal (secure high-performance), method (auth/encryption), and constraint (no performance compromise). | 5 | The specified components are consistent with the overall goal of a secure, high-performance system. | 3 | It specifies security protocols but lacks any concrete performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) that need to be assured. | 4.0 | A clear and coherent intent, but its value is significantly undermined by the use of non-standard terminology for a core security parameter. |
| 4 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation network slice implementation using Non_Standalone_5G architecture with high-priority deployment complexity and integration requirements. | 5 | All technical concepts mentioned (V2X, network slicing, Non-Standalone 5G) are correct and well-defined within 3GPP standards. | 4 | This intent involves complex, interconnected concepts like V2X, network slicing, and deployment architecture analysis. | 3 | The sentence is long and the phrasing "high-priority deployment complexity" is awkward, making it less clear than it could be. | 5 | A request to analyze a specific deployment scenario fits the "Intent Feasibility Check" type perfectly. | 4 | The core idea is logical, but the final clause about "complexity and integration requirements" feels slightly tacked on and convolutes the structure. | 5 | V2X, network slicing, and NSA are all consistent and relevant technologies for the autonomous transportation use case. | 4 | It defines the use case, technology, and analysis areas. It would be more complete with specific performance targets to check against. | 4.3 | A relevant and technically sound feasibility check, although its readability and structure could be improved for better clarity. |
| 5 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 3hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | 5G_AKA is a correct authentication method. However, `256_NEA1` is non-standard terminology, as 3GPP NAS encryption algorithms (NEA) are 128-bit. | 3 | The intent specifies standard security events alongside a non-standard one, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easily understandable for both automation and human operators. | 5 | The description clearly defines conditions for an alert, which is the primary function of a regular notification request. | 5 | The structure is logical, defining the trigger condition, priority, and a related event notification. | 5 | All components of the request are internally consistent and relate to network security management. | 4 | It specifies the trigger events and priority. For full completeness, it could define the notification target or format. | 4.1 | A well-structured notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by the use of incorrect, non-standard terminology for the encryption algorithm. |
| 6 | Deployment Intent | "Execute research-grade sophisticated with mission-critical cutting-edge innovations vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation network slice deployment featuring Massive_MIMO_64T64R antenna systems with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated 3D_Beamforming beamforming capabilities across 800MHz/2.6GHz/39GHz spectrum bands, optimized for Dense_Urban coverage scenarios." | 5 | All technical specifications (V2X, slice, Massive MIMO 64T64R, 3D Beamforming, spectrum bands, Dense Urban) are correct and align with 3GPP concepts. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying a complete radio deployment scenario with multiple advanced, interacting parameters. | 1 | The intent is severely bloated with redundant, qualitative marketing terms ("research-grade sophisticated," "mission-critical cutting-edge"), making it extremely difficult to parse. | 5 | Despite the poor readability, the core request is to deploy a V2X network slice, which is a valid deployment intent. | 2 | The core technical request is coherent, but it's obscured by layers of repetitive, unstructured adjectives that disrupt the logical flow. | 4 | The technical details are consistent. However, the repeated and contradictory qualifiers ("research-grade" vs "mission-critical") create confusion. | 5 | This intent is very complete, specifying the use case, radio technology, antenna configuration, beamforming type, frequency bands, and deployment environment. | 3.9 | A technically rich and complete intent that is rendered almost unusable by excessive, unparsable buzzwords, highlighting the importance of clarity in intent-based systems. |
| 7 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with mission-critical 6 ARM64 cores and 27GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | While specific hardware isn't standardized by 3GPP, describing compute resources for Network Functions (NFs) is a valid and correct concept in NFV/5G. | 2 | The intent specifies basic compute resources (cores, memory), which is relatively low in complexity. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and provides exact parameters suitable for an infrastructure orchestrator. | 5 | The intent to "provision" resources is a direct match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is structured perfectly: action (provision), resources (cores, memory), and purpose (for network functions). | 5 | The specified core count, architecture (ARM64), and memory type/amount (DDR5) are internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is specific about CPU and RAM. It could be more complete by including storage or network interface requirements. | 4.4 | An excellent example of a clear, concise, and actionable resource provisioning intent. |
| 8 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 33GB LPDDR5 memory and 6413GB NVMe_SSD storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 5 | The concepts of evaluating resource requirements and analyzing performance impact are standard practice in network planning and orchestration. | 3 | It involves evaluating specific hardware components and their performance impact, which has moderate technical complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and easily understandable. | 5 | The intent to "evaluate" requirements and "analyze" impact is a perfect fit for a feasibility check. | 5 | The intent is structured logically: action (evaluate), subjects (memory, storage), and focus of analysis (performance impact). | 5 | The specified memory (LPDDR5) and storage (NVMe SSD) types are consistent and represent a plausible hardware configuration. | 4 | The intent is specific about memory and storage. It could be more complete by mentioning the workload or NF for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.6 | A clear, well-formed, and relevant feasibility check for infrastructure resource planning. |
| 9 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 116 core utilization and 268GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific Network Function (AMF) is a standard operational task aligned with 3GPP management functions. | 3 | It requests a standard performance report with specific metrics (core/memory utilization), indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and specifies the exact scope and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent to "generate" a "report" is a direct match for the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The intent logically specifies the subject (AMF), the metrics for analysis (core/memory usage), and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing core utilization and memory consumption for a specific NF (AMF) are consistent and typical performance metrics. | 5 | The request is very complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the specific values observed, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | An exemplary report request that is specific, actionable, and provides all necessary context for an analytics function. |
| 10 | Modification Intent | Adjust Massive_MIMO_32T32R radio parameters and Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming configuration with mission-critical core network coordination. | 5 | Massive MIMO (32T32R) and Horizontal Beamforming are standard 3GPP radio technologies. The need for coordination with the core network is also a valid operational concept. | 4 | Modifying radio parameters like beamforming requires a good understanding of RAN-Core interaction, making it a reasonably complex task. | 4 | The intent is clear, but "core network coordination" is slightly vague. Specifying which part of the core would improve it. | 5 | The intent to "adjust" existing parameters is a perfect example of a "Modification Intent." | 5 | The structure is logical: action (adjust), target (MIMO/beamforming parameters), and a necessary condition (core network coordination). | 5 | The components (Massive MIMO, beamforming, core network) are all consistent parts of a 5G mobile network that require coordination. | 4 | It specifies what to change but not the target values for the parameters, which would be needed for execution. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant modification intent, clearly stating the target of the change, though it could be more specific about the desired outcome. |
| 11 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Establish comprehensive GOLD_TIER Service Level Agreement with high-priority 99.99% availability guarantee and 99.9% reliability commitment, implementing production-ready comprehensive monitoring and automated remediation capabilities." | 4 | While SLA tiers like "GOLD_TIER" are operator-specific, the concepts of availability, reliability, monitoring, and remediation are central to 3GPP-aligned network management and assurance. | 4 | Defining and enforcing an SLA with specific numerical targets and requiring automated remediation is a complex task. | 4 | The intent is well-written, but contains some redundant words like "comprehensive" which add little value for automation. | 5 | The goal of establishing and maintaining an SLA directly relates to assuring a certain level of performance. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, stating the goal (SLA), defining key metrics (availability, reliability), and specifying the required capabilities (monitoring, remediation). | 5 | The specified availability and reliability metrics, along with monitoring and remediation, are all consistent components of an SLA framework. | 4 | The intent defines key SLA metrics but could be more complete by specifying performance metrics like latency or throughput. | 4.4 | A comprehensive and realistic performance assurance intent that defines a clear business-level objective with technical enforcement mechanisms. |
| 12 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 70 x86_64 processing cores at 3.36GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Assessing the feasibility of deploying a 3GPP Network Function (AMF) on specific hardware is a standard and valid operational planning task. | 3 | The task involves mapping NF requirements to hardware specifications, which is a moderately complex analysis. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and provides all necessary parameters for the feasibility study. | 5 | The request to "assess feasibility" perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured: action (assess feasibility), subject (AMF deployment), hardware context (cores, clock speed), and analysis criteria (requirements, constraints). | 5 | The specified parameters (AMF, x86_64 cores, clock speed, performance constraints) are all consistent and relevant to the task. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing the NF, the exact hardware to be assessed, and the context for the assessment. | 4.9 | An excellent, well-defined feasibility check that is precise, actionable, and complete. |

| 14 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 79 core utilization and 29GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report for an AMF with a focus on "deterministic performance" is a valid and specific management task, especially relevant for URLLC support. | 4 | Adding the "deterministic" constraint increases the complexity of the analysis beyond standard reporting, as it implies analyzing jitter and worst-case performance. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and provides specific metrics and context for the report. | 5 | This is a clear request to "generate" a "report," fitting the intent type perfectly. | 5 | The structure is logical, specifying the report type (deterministic performance), subject (AMF), metrics, and desired output. | 5 | Analyzing core/memory usage in the context of deterministic performance is a consistent and valid request. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the NF, metrics, context (deterministic), and desired analytical output. | 4.9 | An excellent and specific report request that introduces the important concept of deterministic performance analysis. |
| 15 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 20hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method. However, `256_NEA2` is non-standard terminology, as 3GPP NAS encryption algorithms (NEA) are 128-bit. This is a significant error. | 3 | The intent specifies a mix of standard and non-standard security events, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easily parsable for an automation system, despite the technical error. | 5 | The description clearly defines conditions for an alert, which is the primary function of a regular notification request. | 5 | The structure is logical: trigger condition, a related event notification, and a specified time interval. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent and relate to network security management. | 4 | The intent specifies the trigger events and a time parameter. It could be more complete by defining the notification target. | 4.1 | A well-structured notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by the use of incorrect, non-standard terminology for the encryption algorithm. |
| 16 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 107ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.00611 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and error rate are standard 5G QoS parameters. Configuring them to assure performance is a valid intent. The error rate is likely referring to Packet Error Rate (PER). | 4 | Configuring and enforcing strict PDB and error rate targets requires complex traffic engineering and QoS management mechanisms. | 5 | The intent is clear, quantitative, and directly actionable by a network management system. | 5 | The goal of configuring QoS parameters to meet specific targets is a core function of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent structure is logical: action (configure), parameters (delay budget, error rate), and method (traffic engineering). | 5 | The packet delay budget and error rate are consistent and complementary QoS parameters. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing specific numerical targets for the key QoS parameters to be configured. | 4.9 | An excellent, precise, and actionable performance assurance intent that uses standard QoS terminology correctly. |
| 17 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 924Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 30.15ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are standard 5G QoS parameters used to define a service or slice. | 4 | Launching a service with strict, guaranteed QoS parameters is a complex task involving resource reservation and traffic management. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the combination of "low priority" and "mission-critical applications" is a direct contradiction. | 5 | The intent to "launch" a "network service" with specific characteristics is a clear deployment intent. | 5 | The intent logically defines the service parameters (priority, bitrate, delay) and its purpose (supporting mission-critical apps). | 1 | There is a major internal contradiction between "low priority" and "mission-critical applications with deterministic performance." These two concepts are mutually exclusive. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key QoS parameters for the new service. | 4.1 | A technically well-specified intent that is rendered invalid by a fundamental contradiction in its description, making it impossible to fulfill as written. |
| 18 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 21hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method.

| 25 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics. | 2 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. However, `256_NEA1` is non-standard terminology; 3GPP NEA algorithms are 128-bit. The typo "high-priorityout" also reduces quality. | 3 | The intent names specific security protocols, indicating a moderate level of technical detail. | 3 | The intent is mostly readable but contains a typo ("high-priorityout") and uses incorrect technical terminology. | 5 | The goal of securing infrastructure while maintaining performance is a core aspect of performance assurance. | 5 | The structure is logical: goal (secure high-performance), method (auth/encryption), and constraint (no performance compromise). | 5 | The specified components are consistent with the overall goal of a secure, high-performance system. | 3 | It specifies security protocols but lacks concrete performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) to be assured. | 3.7 | The intent's goal is relevant, but its credibility is damaged by a significant technical terminology error and a typo. |

| 31 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 55 ARM64 processing cores at 2.7GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Assessing the feasibility of deploying a 3GPP Network Function (AMF) on specific hardware is a standard and valid operational planning task. | 3 | The task involves mapping NF requirements to hardware specifications, which is a moderately complex analysis. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and provides all necessary parameters for the feasibility study. | 5 | The request to "assess feasibility" perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured: action (assess feasibility), subject (AMF deployment), hardware context (cores, clock speed), and analysis criteria (requirements, constraints). | 5 | The specified parameters (AMF, ARM64 cores, clock speed, performance constraints) are all consistent and relevant to the task. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing the NF, the exact hardware to be assessed, and the context for the assessment. | 4.9 | An excellent, well-defined feasibility check that is precise, actionable, and complete. |
| 32 | Deployment Intent | "Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 2507Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 38.7ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms." | 5 | The intent correctly uses standard concepts: eMBB, network slice, throughput, and latency constraints, which are key performance indicators in 5G. | 4 | Optimizing a slice to meet specific, high-performance targets for throughput and latency is a complex task. | 4 | The intent is clear and quantitative, but starts with "Optimize," which sounds like a modification intent. However, the context implies deploying an optimized slice. The "high-high-throughput" is redundant. | 4 | While it says "Optimize," the act of achieving specific performance targets for a slice is a form of deployment or service creation. It straddles the line between deployment and modification. | 5 | The intent is structured logically: goal (optimize eMBB slice), targets (throughput, latency), and method (traffic engineering). | 4 | The specified throughput and latency targets are consistent. The redundancy in "high-high-throughput" is a minor inconsistency. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing the slice type and specific, numerical targets for key performance indicators. | 4.4 | A strong, quantitative intent for service creation/optimization, though the choice of "Optimize" as the leading verb makes the intent type slightly ambiguous. |
| 33 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 27 ARM64 processing cores at 3.02GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Assessing the feasibility of deploying a 3GPP Network Function (AMF) on specific hardware is a standard and valid operational planning task. | 3 | The task involves mapping NF requirements to hardware specifications, which is a moderately complex analysis. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and provides all necessary parameters for the feasibility study. | 5 | The request to "assess feasibility" perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured: action (assess feasibility), subject (AMF deployment), hardware context (cores, clock speed), and analysis criteria (requirements, constraints). | 5 | The specified parameters (AMF, ARM64 cores, clock speed, performance constraints) are all consistent and relevant to the task. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing the NF, the exact hardware to be assessed, and the context for the assessment. | 4.9 | An excellent, well-defined feasibility check that is precise, actionable, and complete. |
| 34 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 108 processing cores and 47GB memory allocation with high-priority 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | Adjusting compute resources (scaling) for network functions is a standard operation in an NFV environment. | 3 | Adjusting resource allocation is a common but moderately complex task, requiring interaction with an orchestrator. | 5 | The intent is perfectly clear, providing exact numerical targets for all parameters. | 5 | The intent to "adjust" resources is a canonical example of a modification intent. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (adjust), parameters (cores, memory, timeout), and goals (performance, cost efficiency). | 5 | The specified parameters—cores, memory, and an execution timeout—are consistent and common in resource management. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the exact target values for the resources being modified. | 4.9 | An exemplary modification intent that is clear, specific, and actionable for a resource orchestrator. |
| 35 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 15GB LPDDR5 memory and 6584GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | The concepts of evaluating resource requirements and analyzing performance impact are standard practice in network planning and orchestration. | 3 | It involves evaluating specific hardware components and their performance impact, which has moderate technical complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and easily understandable. | 5 | The intent to "evaluate" requirements and "analyze" impact is a perfect fit for a feasibility check. | 5 | The intent is structured logically: action (evaluate), subjects (memory, storage), and focus of analysis (performance impact). | 5 | The specified memory (LPDDR5) and storage (NVMe PCIe4) types are consistent and represent a plausible hardware configuration. | 4 | The intent is specific about memory and storage. It could be more complete by mentioning the workload or NF for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.6 | A clear, well-formed, and relevant feasibility check for infrastructure resource planning. |
| 36 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-836-7959] | 5 | Throughput and latency are standard performance metrics. "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" is a plausible, albeit implementation-specific, mechanism for assurance. | 4 | Achieving high throughput and ultra-low latency simultaneously, managed by an intelligent scaling mechanism, is a complex performance engineering challenge. | 4 | The intent is clear and quantitative, although "high-capacity" is redundant with "high-throughput." | 5 | The goal is to achieve and maintain specific performance levels, which is the core of performance assurance. | 5 | The structure is logical: goal (implement high-performance networking), targets (throughput, latency), and method (intelligent scaling). | 4 | High throughput and ultra-low latency are often conflicting goals, but they are consistent parameters to manage. The redundancy of "high-capacity" is a minor issue. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing specific numerical targets for both throughput and latency. | 4.6 | A very strong performance assurance intent with clear, quantitative targets and a specified assurance mechanism. |
| 37 | Deployment Intent | Manage comprehensive GOLD_TIER Service Level Agreement enforcement guaranteeing 9931Mbps high-throughput performance and 13.9ms latency requirements through intelligent resource orchestration. | 4 | While SLA tiers are operator-specific, the intent to enforce throughput and latency via orchestration is aligned with 3GPP management principles. | 4 | Enforcing a strict, high-performance SLA requires complex, real-time resource orchestration and monitoring. | 4 | The intent is clear, but "Manage" and "enforcement" are closer to performance assurance. However, deploying the enforcement mechanism itself can be seen as a deployment intent. | 4 | This could be interpreted as either a Performance Assurance or Deployment intent. It's about "deploying" the enforcement of an SLA. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (manage/enforce), object (GOLD_TIER SLA), parameters (throughput, latency), and method (orchestration). | 5 | The SLA parameters (throughput, latency) and the enforcement method (orchestration) are consistent and logically linked. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing a tier name and specific numerical targets for key performance metrics. | 4.4 | A well-defined intent that clearly states its business and technical goals, though it blurs the line between deployment and assurance. |
| 38 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy intelligent edge massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems infrastructure with mission-critical DISTRIBUTED deployment strategy supporting 237150_devices_per_km2 device massive connectivity high-density, enabling ultra-low latency applications and local data processing." | 5 | The intent correctly uses standard 3GPP concepts like mMTC, device density, and edge computing (for low latency and local processing). | 5 | This describes a complex deployment involving edge computing, high-density mMTC, and a distributed architecture, which requires significant planning and orchestration. | 4 | The intent is highly detailed and clear, though the phrase "massive connectivity high-density" is a bit redundant. | 5 | The request to "deploy" an "infrastructure" for a specific 5G service (mMTC) is a perfect fit for a deployment intent. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, specifying the what (mMTC edge infrastructure), the strategy (distributed), the key parameter (device density), and the purpose. | 5 | All components—mMTC, edge, high device density, low latency, and local processing—are consistent and characteristic of this use case. | 5 | The intent is extremely complete, providing the service type, architecture, and a key quantitative requirement (device density). | 4.9 | An excellent, detailed, and technically rich deployment intent that captures the key requirements of an advanced IoT/mMTC use case. |
| 39 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with mission-critical 17hours automated key management. | 2 | 5G_AKA and automated key management are correct. However, `256_NEA2` is non-standard terminology, as 3GPP NEA algorithms are 128-bit. "Performance assurance" is also misused; this is a security intent. | 3 | Implementing fault-tolerant security mechanisms with automated key management is a moderately complex task. | 4 | The description is clear and specific, but it describes a security configuration, not a performance assurance goal. | 1 | The intent describes security implementation (authentication, encryption, key management), not performance assurance (e.g., latency, throughput). This is a severe mismatch. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, listing the security mechanisms to be used. | 5 | The specified security components (authentication, encryption, key management) are internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is complete in specifying the security mechanisms, but it completely misses any performance-related parameters. | 3.4 | This intent is fundamentally flawed due to a mismatch between the intent type (Performance Assurance) and the description (Security). It is also weakened by incorrect technical terminology. |
| 40 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 14hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method. However, `256_NEA1` is non-standard terminology, as 3GPP NAS encryption algorithms (NEA) are 128-bit. | 3 | The intent specifies a mix of standard and non-standard security events, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easily parsable, despite the technical error. | 5 | The description clearly defines conditions for an alert, which matches the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: trigger condition, a related event notification, and a specified time interval. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent and relate to network security management. | 4 | The intent specifies the trigger events and a time parameter. It could be more complete by defining the notification target. | 4.1 | A well-structured notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by the use of incorrect, non-standard terminology for the encryption algorithm. |
| 41 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 224.08ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are standard 5G QoS parameters. The use of "deterministic" is appropriate for critical applications. | 4 | Launching a service with strict, guaranteed QoS parameters, especially for critical applications, is a complex undertaking. | 4 | The intent is clear and quantitative, but the repetition of "mission-critical" is excessive and reduces readability for automation. | 5 | The intent to "launch" a "network service" with specific characteristics is a clear deployment intent. | 5 | The intent logically defines the service parameters (priority, bitrate, delay) and its purpose (supporting mission-critical apps). | 5 | All specified parameters—critical priority, GBR, strict PDB, and deterministic characteristics—are consistent and reinforce each other. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key QoS parameters for the new service. | 4.7 | A strong, technically sound deployment intent for a critical service, slightly marred by redundant phrasing. |
| 42 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 98GB HBM2 memory and 827GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | The concepts of evaluating resource requirements and analyzing performance impact are standard practice in network planning and orchestration. | 3 | It involves evaluating specific hardware components and their performance impact, which has moderate technical complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and easily understandable. | 5 | The intent to "evaluate" requirements and "analyze" impact is a perfect fit for a feasibility check. | 5 | The intent is structured logically: action (evaluate), subjects (memory, storage), and focus of analysis (performance impact). | 5 | The specified memory (HBM2) and storage (NVMe SSD) types are consistent and represent a plausible high-performance hardware configuration. | 4 | The intent is specific about memory and storage. It could be more complete by mentioning the workload or NF for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.6 | A clear, well-formed, and relevant feasibility check for infrastructure resource planning. |
| 43 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 78GB DDR4 memory and 1988GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | The concepts of evaluating resource requirements and analyzing performance impact are standard practice in network planning and orchestration. | 3 | It involves evaluating specific hardware components and their performance impact, which has moderate technical complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and easily understandable. | 5 | The intent to "evaluate" requirements and "analyze" impact is a perfect fit for a feasibility check. | 5 | The intent is structured logically: action (evaluate), subjects (memory, storage), and focus of analysis (performance impact). | 5 | The specified memory (DDR4) and storage (NVMe PCIe4) types are consistent and represent a plausible hardware configuration. | 4 | The intent is specific about memory and storage. It could be more complete by mentioning the workload or NF for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.6 | A clear, well-formed, and relevant feasibility check for infrastructure resource planning. |
| 44 | Performance Assurance Intent | Monitor through Jaeger AI-enhanced tracing with mission-critical intelligent correlation and root cause analysis. | 4 | While Jaeger is a specific (non-3GPP) tool, distributed tracing is a key technique for monitoring microservice-based architectures like 5G SBA. The use of AI for correlation and RCA is aligned with advanced assurance concepts (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | Implementing AI-enhanced tracing with intelligent correlation and RCA is a highly complex assurance task. | 4 | The intent is clear but could be more specific. "Monitor" what? It lacks the specific service or KPIs to be monitored. | 5 | The intent to "monitor" with advanced analysis capabilities is directly related to performance assurance. | 5 | The intent is logically structured: action (monitor), tool/method (Jaeger tracing), and capabilities (AI correlation, RCA). | 5 | The use of tracing, correlation, and root cause analysis are all consistent and complementary monitoring techniques. | 2 | The intent is very incomplete. It describes the "how" (tools/methods) but completely omits the "what" (the service, application, or KPIs to monitor). | 4.1 | A conceptually strong intent that describes a modern approach to assurance, but it is too vague to be actionable as it lacks a monitoring target. |
| 45 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 85 core utilization and 144GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific Network Function (AMF) is a standard operational task. | 3 | This is a request for a standard performance analysis report, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and specifies the exact scope and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent to "generate" a "report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically specifies the subject (AMF), the metrics for analysis (core/memory usage), and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing core utilization and memory consumption for an AMF are consistent and typical performance metrics. | 5 | The request is very complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the specific values observed, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | An exemplary report request that is specific, actionable, and provides all necessary context for an analytics function. |
| 46 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with 3 ARM64 cores and 12GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | While specific hardware isn't standardized by 3GPP, describing compute resources for Network Functions (NFs) is a valid and correct concept in NFV/5G. | 2 | The intent specifies basic compute resources (cores, memory), which is relatively low in complexity. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and provides exact parameters suitable for an infrastructure orchestrator. | 5 | The intent to "provision" resources is a direct match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is structured perfectly: action (provision), resources (cores, memory), and purpose (for network functions). | 5 | The specified core count, architecture (ARM64), and memory type/amount (DDR4) are internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is specific about CPU and RAM. It could be more complete by including storage or network interface requirements. | 4.4 | An excellent example of a clear, concise, and actionable resource provisioning intent. |
| 47 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 31 core utilization and 387GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific Network Function (AMF) is a standard operational task. | 3 | This is a request for a standard performance analysis report, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and specifies the exact scope and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent to "generate" a "report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically specifies the subject (AMF), the metrics for analysis (core/memory usage), and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing core utilization and memory consumption for an AMF are consistent and typical performance metrics. | 5 | The request is very complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the specific values observed, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | An exemplary report request that is specific, actionable, and provides all necessary context for an analytics function. |
| 48 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 20hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-848-8003] | 5 | Certificate-based authentication and 128-NEA1 (AES) are both standard 3GPP security mechanisms. | 3 | The intent specifies standard security events and parameters, showing a moderate level of technical detail. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and easily parsable. | 5 | The description is a classic notification request, specifying conditions for an alert, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The request is structured logically: condition, and a related event notification with a time parameter. | 4 | Alerting on failures/breaches is consistent. Linking a key rotation notification is logical but could be a separate action; however, it doesn't create a contradiction. | 4 | The intent specifies the events to monitor and priority. It could be more complete by defining the notification channel or recipient. | 4.4 | An excellent, standards-aligned notification intent that is clear, specific, and actionable. |
| 49 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 80 core utilization and 23GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific Network Function (AMF) is a standard operational task. | 3 | This is a request for a standard performance analysis report, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and specifies the exact scope and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent to "generate" a "report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically specifies the subject (AMF), the metrics for analysis (core/memory usage), and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing core utilization and memory consumption for an AMF are consistent and typical performance metrics. | 5 | The request is very complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the specific values observed, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | An exemplary report request that is specific, actionable, and provides all necessary context for an analytics function. |
| 50 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 17hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | 5G_AKA is a correct authentication method. However, `256_NEA1` is non-standard terminology, as 3GPP NAS encryption algorithms (NEA) are 128-bit. | 3 | The intent specifies a mix of standard and non-standard security events, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easily parsable, despite the technical error. | 5 | The description clearly defines conditions for an alert, which matches the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: trigger condition, a related event notification, and a specified time interval. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent and relate to network security management. | 4 | The intent specifies the trigger events and a time parameter. It could be more complete by defining the notification target. | 4.1 | A well-structured notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by the use of incorrect, non-standard terminology for the encryption algorithm. |
| 51 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with high-priority 18hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | All specified technologies (EAP-AKA', 128-NEA3 for ZUC) are correct and standard 3GPP security mechanisms. | 3 | The intent specifies standard security events and parameters, showing a moderate level of technical detail. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and easily parsable. | 5 | The description is a classic notification request, specifying conditions for an alert, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The request is structured logically: condition, priority, and a related event notification. | 4 | Alerting on failures/breaches is consistent.

It could be more complete by defining the notification channel or recipient. | 4.4 | An excellent, standards-aligned notification intent that is clear, specific, and actionable. |
| 52 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications monitoring with high-priority Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for deterministic performance degradation. | 4 | URLLC, anomaly detection, and proactive alerting are valid concepts in 5G management (e.g., NWDAF). Isolation Forest is a plausible, non-standard algorithm choice. "ultra-ultra-reliable" and "low-ultra-low" are awkward tautologies. | 5 | This describes a complex, closed-loop monitoring and alerting system for URLLC services, involving advanced analytics. | 3 | The intent is understandable but poorly phrased with excessive repetition ("ultra-ultra-reliable"). The leading verb "Configure" is also ambiguous, sounding more like a deployment/modification intent. | 3 | This is a request for alerting, but it's framed as a configuration/deployment of a monitoring system. The intent type and description are not perfectly aligned. | 4 | The core idea of monitoring URLLC with anomaly detection is coherent, but the sentence structure is convoluted. | 4 | The technical concepts are consistent. The only issue is the awkward, repetitive phrasing. | 4 | The intent is reasonably complete, specifying the service (URLLC), method (Isolation Forest), and trigger (performance degradation). | 3.9 | A conceptually sophisticated intent that is let down by very poor wording and a slight mismatch between the action ("Configure") and the intent type ("Request"). |

| 54 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 55 processing cores and 276GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | Adjusting compute resources (scaling) for network functions is a standard operation in an NFV environment. | 3 | Adjusting resource allocation is a common but moderately complex task, requiring interaction with an orchestrator. | 5 | The intent is perfectly clear, providing exact numerical targets for all parameters. | 5 | The intent to "adjust" resources is a canonical example of a modification intent. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (adjust), parameters (cores, memory, timeout), and goals (performance, cost efficiency). | 5 | The specified parameters—cores, memory, and an execution timeout—are consistent and common in resource management. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the exact target values for the resources being modified. | 4.9 | An exemplary modification intent that is clear, specific, and actionable for a resource orchestrator. |
| 55 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 710ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | While "response time" is a generic metric, it's a valid performance indicator. The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with modern assurance concepts (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | Implementing a closed loop of predictive analytics and automated remediation to meet a specific performance target is a complex task. | 5 | The intent is clear, quantitative, and specifies both the target metric and the methods to achieve it. | 5 | The goal to "optimize performance" to a specific target is a core function of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent is well-structured: goal (optimize performance), target (710ms response time), and method (predictive analytics, auto-remediation). | 5 | The target metric (response time) and the methods (analytics, remediation) are consistent and logically connected. | 4 | The intent is specific about the target response time but could be more complete by defining what service or transaction this response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong performance assurance intent that describes a modern, analytics-driven approach to performance management. |
| 56 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | All specified technologies (EAP-TLS, 128-NEA1 for AES) are correct and standard 3GPP security mechanisms. | 3 | The intent specifies standard security events and parameters, showing a moderate level of technical detail. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and easily parsable. | 5 | The description is a classic notification request, specifying conditions for an alert, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The request is structured logically: condition, and a related event notification with a time parameter. | 4 | Alerting on failures/breaches is consistent. Linking a key rotation notification is logical but could be a separate action; however, it doesn't create a contradiction. | 4 | The intent specifies the events to monitor and priority.

| 98 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 2hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. However, `256_NEA1` is non-standard terminology, as 3GPP NEA algorithms are 128-bit. | 3 | The intent specifies a mix of standard and non-standard security events, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easily parsable, despite the technical error. | 5 | The description clearly defines conditions for an alert, which matches the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: trigger condition, a related event notification, and a specified time interval. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent and relate to network security management. | 4 | The intent specifies the trigger events and a time parameter. It could be more complete by defining the notification target. | 4.1 | A well-structured notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by the use of incorrect, non-standard terminology for the encryption algorithm. |

The need for coordination with the core network is also a valid operational concept. | 4 | Modifying radio parameters like beamforming requires a good understanding of RAN-Core interaction, making it a reasonably complex task. | 4 | The intent is clear, but "core network coordination" is slightly vague.

The named algorithms are plausible non-standard choices. | 5 | This describes a highly complex assurance system combining anomaly detection and predictive analytics for the difficult task of managing deterministic performance. | 4 | The intent is clear, but it's very abstract. It doesn't specify what part of the network or which KPIs to monitor. | 5 | The goal to "monitor... performance" to enable "proactive... management" is a core tenet of performance assurance. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (monitor), subject (deterministic performance), methods (Isolation Forest, Prophet), and goal (proactive management). | 5 | The use of anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) and forecasting (Prophet) are consistent and complementary techniques for proactive monitoring. | 2 | The intent is very incomplete. It describes the "how" (tools/methods) but completely omits the "what" (the service, NFs, or KPIs to monitor for deterministic performance). | 4.3 | A conceptually sophisticated intent that describes a modern assurance methodology, but it is too vague to be actionable as it lacks a monitoring target. |
| 112 | Modification Intent | "Update artificial intelligence models to lstm_with_attention_mechanism achieving 87.74% prediction accuracy with multi_objective_genetic_algorithm optimization algorithms, enhancing intelligent network operations." | 4 | While the specific AI/ML models are non-standard implementation details, the concept of updating models used for network management (like in NWDAF) is valid. | 5 | This describes a highly complex modification, involving swapping out an AI model for a more advanced one and using a sophisticated optimization algorithm. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, technical, and clear about the new model, its target performance, and the optimization method. | 5 | The intent to "update" an "artificial intelligence model" is a clear modification intent. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (update), target (AI models), new model spec, target metric (accuracy), optimization method, and goal. | 5 | The components—a sophisticated prediction model (LSTM with attention), an optimization algorithm (GA), and a performance metric (accuracy)—are all consistent with advanced AI operations. | 4 | The intent is very complete regarding the model, but it could be more complete by stating which network function or service this model is used for. | 4.7 | An excellent, highly specific intent representing an advanced, AI-driven network operation, demonstrating the future direction of network management. |

| 119 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 109 processing cores and 198GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core network resource allocation is a valid intent. However, "core network" is too generic; it should specify an NF. "Transport network optimization" is also vague. | 3 | Modifying resources for the "core network" is a significant task, but the lack of specificity makes it hard to gauge true complexity. | 3 | The intent is not very readable for automation because "core network" is not a single entity to allocate resources to. It needs to be more specific (e.g., AMF, SMF). | 5 | The intent to "modify" resource allocation fits the intent type. | 4 | The structure is logical (action, resources, linked optimization), but the terms are too general. | 5 | The allocation of processing and memory resources is consistent with network function management. | 2 | The intent is critically incomplete. It fails to specify which Network Function(s) in the core network should be modified. | 3.7 | A conceptually valid but practically unusable intent due to its vagueness.

| 120 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with high-priority 23hours automated key management. | 2 | EAP-TLS is correct. `256_NEA2` is non-standard terminology. More importantly, the intent describes a security configuration, not a performance assurance goal. | 3 | Implementing security mechanisms with automated key management is a moderately complex task. | 4 | The description is clear and specific about the security mechanisms, but it's miscategorized as a performance intent. | 1 | The intent is about implementing security policies (authentication, encryption), not assuring performance metrics (latency, throughput). This is a severe mismatch. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, listing the security mechanisms to be used. | 5 | The specified security components (authentication, encryption, key management) are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent is complete in specifying the security setup but completely misses any performance-related parameters. | 3.3 | This intent is fundamentally flawed. It has a severe mismatch between the intent type (Performance Assurance) and the description (Security), and it uses incorrect technical terminology. |
| 121 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 297ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.007864 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and error rate are standard 5G QoS parameters.

The choice of 4T4R MIMO is a specific design parameter. | 4 | The intent is clear but contains a minor contradiction: it mixes terminology from mMTC ("massive connectivity") and URLLC ("ultra-reliable"). | 5 | The intent to "execute... deployment" of an mMTC service is a perfect fit for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, specifying the service (mMTC), architecture (SA), and a key radio parameter (MIMO). | 3 | There is a logical inconsistency. mMTC focuses on "massive connectivity," while "ultra-reliable" is the hallmark of URLLC. While a service can have elements of both, the phrasing is confusing. | 5 | The intent is complete in describing the high-level service, architecture, and radio configuration. | 4.4 | A strong deployment intent that is mostly correct but is weakened by confusingly mixing the key characteristics of two different 5G service types (mMTC and URLLC). |
| 182 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with 4 x86_64 cores and 9GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | While specific hardware isn't standardized by 3GPP, describing compute resources for Network Functions (NFs) is a valid and correct concept in NFV/5G. | 2 | The intent specifies basic compute resources (cores, memory), which is relatively low in complexity. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and provides exact parameters suitable for an infrastructure orchestrator. | 5 | The intent to "provision" resources is a direct match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is structured perfectly: action (provision), resources (cores, memory), and purpose (for network functions). | 5 | The specified core count, architecture (x86_64), and memory type/amount (DDR4) are internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is specific about CPU and RAM. It could be more complete by including storage or network interface requirements. | 4.4 | An excellent example of a clear, concise, and actionable resource provisioning intent. |
| 183 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Establish comprehensive CUSTOM_TIER Service Level Agreement with high-priority 99.99% availability guarantee and 99.9% reliability commitment, implementing research-grade sophisticated monitoring and automated remediation capabilities." | 4 | While SLA tiers are operator-specific, the concepts of availability, reliability, monitoring, and remediation are central to 3GPP-aligned network management and assurance. | 4 | Defining and enforcing an SLA with specific numerical targets and requiring automated remediation is a complex task. | 3 | The intent is clear but uses buzzwords like "research-grade sophisticated" which are not ideal for automation. | 5 | The goal of establishing and maintaining an SLA directly relates to assuring a certain level of performance. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, stating the goal (SLA), defining key metrics (availability, reliability), and specifying the required capabilities. | 4 | The components are consistent, but the use of "research-grade" for a production SLA commitment is slightly contradictory. | 4 | The intent defines key SLA metrics but could be more complete by specifying performance metrics like latency or throughput. | 4.1 | A good performance assurance intent that is slightly undermined by the use of vague, unquantifiable buzzwords. |
| 184 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous deterministic performance optimization using fault-tolerant lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism machine learning models with mission-critical 92.16% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 4 | The concepts of autonomous optimization and deterministic performance are aligned with advanced 5G management (e.g., NWDAF). The specific ML model is a non-standard implementation detail. | 5 | This describes a highly complex, closed-loop assurance system based on a specific, sophisticated ML model to achieve deterministic performance. | 3 | The intent is verbose and contains repetitive "mission-critical" qualifiers. The core request is understandable but could be more concise. | 5 | The goal to "implement... optimization" for "deterministic performance" is a clear match for performance assurance. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, but it's a long, single clause. It specifies the goal, method (ML model), and a target metric for the model itself (accuracy). | 5 | The components—autonomous optimization, ML models, prediction accuracy, and deterministic performance—are all consistent with an advanced AI-driven assurance system. | 3 | The intent is specific about the ML model and its accuracy, but it fails to mention which network KPIs (e.g., jitter, latency) are being optimized. | 4.1 | A conceptually advanced and relevant intent that is hindered by verbose phrasing and a lack of specificity regarding the actual network performance targets. |
| 185 | Deployment Intent | "Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 7334Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 25.7ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms." | 5 | The intent correctly uses standard concepts: eMBB, network slice, throughput, and latency constraints, which are key performance indicators in 5G. | 4 | Optimizing a slice to meet specific, high-performance targets for throughput and latency is a complex task. | 4 | The intent is clear and quantitative, but starts with "Optimize," which sounds like a modification intent. However, the context implies deploying an optimized slice. The "high-high-throughput" is redundant. | 4 | While it says "Optimize," the act of achieving specific performance targets for a slice is a form of deployment or service creation. It straddles the line between deployment and modification. | 5 | The intent is structured logically: goal (optimize eMBB slice), targets (throughput, latency), and method (traffic engineering). | 4 | The specified throughput and latency targets are consistent. The redundancy in "high-high-throughput" is a minor inconsistency. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing the slice type and specific, numerical targets for key performance indicators. | 4.4 | A strong, quantitative intent for service creation/optimization, though the choice of "Optimize" as the leading verb makes the intent type slightly ambiguous. |
| 186 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 107 processing cores and 99GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | Adjusting compute resources for network functions while considering deterministic performance is a standard and advanced operation in an NFV environment. | 3 | Adjusting resource allocation is a common but moderately complex task, requiring interaction with an orchestrator. | 5 | The intent is perfectly clear, providing exact numerical targets for all parameters and a clear objective. | 5 | The intent to "adjust" resources is a canonical example of a modification intent. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (adjust), parameters (cores, memory, timeout), and goals (deterministic performance, cost efficiency). | 5 | The specified parameters—cores, memory, and timeout—are consistent with the goal of optimizing for deterministic performance. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the exact target values for the resources being modified. | 4.9 | An exemplary modification intent that is clear, specific, and correctly links resource allocation to the goal of deterministic performance. |
| 187 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 46 processing cores and 247GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core network resource allocation is a valid intent. However, "core network" is too generic; it should specify an NF. "Transport network optimization" is also vague. | 3 | Modifying resources for the "core network" is a significant task, but the lack of specificity makes it hard to gauge true complexity. | 3 | The intent is not very readable for automation because "core network" is not a single entity to allocate resources to. It needs to be more specific (e.g., AMF, SMF). | 5 | The intent to "modify" resource allocation fits the intent type. | 4 | The structure is logical (action, resources, linked optimization), but the terms are too general. | 5 | The allocation of processing and memory resources is consistent with network function management. | 2 | The intent is critically incomplete. It fails to specify which Network Function(s) in the core network should be modified. | 3.7 | A conceptually valid but practically unusable intent due to its vagueness. It fails to specify the target network function for the resource modification. |
| 188 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 454GB HBM2 memory and 2908GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | The concepts of evaluating resource requirements and analyzing performance impact are standard practice in network planning and orchestration. | 3 | It involves evaluating specific hardware components and their performance impact, which has moderate technical complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and easily understandable. | 5 | The intent to "evaluate" requirements and "analyze" impact is a perfect fit for a feasibility check. | 5 | The intent is structured logically: action (evaluate), subjects (memory, storage), and focus of analysis (performance impact). | 5 | The specified memory (HBM2) and storage (Optane) types are consistent and represent a plausible high-performance hardware configuration. | 4 | The intent is specific about memory and storage. It could be more complete by mentioning the workload or NF for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.6 | A clear, well-formed, and relevant feasibility check for infrastructure resource planning. |
| 189 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy sophisticated HMAC_SHA256 key derivation functions utilizing 256_bit cryptographic keys with automated 3hours rotation intervals, ensuring continuous security posture and cryptographic freshness." | 5 | Using HMAC-SHA256 for integrity and key rotation are standard, correct security practices. | 4 | Implementing and managing automated key rotation is a complex and critical security task. | 4 | The intent is clear and technically sound, but contains filler words like "sophisticated" that add little value for automation. | 5 | The intent to "deploy" a specific security mechanism is a valid deployment action. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (deploy), what (key derivation/rotation), parameters (algorithm, key size, interval), and goals. | 5 | The use of HMAC-SHA256 with 256-bit keys and a defined rotation policy are all consistent parts of a robust security design. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the algorithm, key size, and rotation interval. | 4.7 | An excellent, specific, and technically correct intent for deploying a robust security mechanism. |

It could be more complete by mentioning the workload or NF for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.6 | A clear, well-formed, and relevant feasibility check for infrastructure resource planning. |
| 191 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 87 core utilization and 433GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific Network Function (AMF) is a standard operational task. | 3 | This is a request for a standard performance analysis report, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and specifies the exact scope and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent to "generate" a "report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically specifies the subject (AMF), the metrics for analysis (core/memory usage), and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing core utilization and memory consumption for an AMF are consistent and typical performance metrics. | 5 | The request is very complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the specific values observed, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | An exemplary report request that is specific, actionable, and provides all necessary context for an analytics function. |
| 192 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 7 core utilization and 76GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific Network Function (AMF) is a standard operational task. | 3 | This is a request for a standard performance analysis report, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and specifies the exact scope and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent to "generate" a "report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically specifies the subject (AMF), the metrics for analysis (core/memory usage), and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing core utilization and memory consumption for an AMF are consistent and typical performance metrics. | 5 | The request is very complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the specific values observed, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | An exemplary report request that is specific, actionable, and provides all necessary context for an analytics function. |
| 193 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization with high-priority genetic algorithms for complex performance trade-off management. | 4 | The concept of multi-objective optimization for managing performance trade-offs is valid and aligned with advanced network management. The specific algorithm is a non-standard detail. | 5 | Implementing a multi-objective genetic algorithm for network performance management is a highly complex task. | 2 | The intent is highly redundant ("multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization... with genetic algorithms") and abstract. | 5 | The goal to "implement... optimization" for "performance trade-off management" is a core performance assurance activity. | 4 | The core idea is coherent, but the repetitive phrasing makes it awkward. | 4 | The concepts are consistent, but the wording is highly repetitive. | 1 | The intent is critically incomplete. It describes a method but fails to specify which performance objectives (e.g., latency vs. throughput vs. cost) are being traded off. | 3.6 | A conceptually powerful intent that is rendered unusable by extreme vagueness and poor, repetitive phrasing. It lacks any specific performance targets. |
| 194 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 50 processing cores and 446GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core network resource allocation is a valid intent. However, "core network" is too generic; it should specify an NF. "Transport network optimization" is also vague. | 3 | Modifying resources for the "core network" is a significant task, but the lack of specificity makes it hard to gauge true complexity. | 3 | The intent is not very readable for automation because "core network" is not a single entity to allocate resources to.

It fails to specify the target network function for the resource modification. |
| 195 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1394Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 15.75ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are standard 5G QoS parameters. The use of "deterministic" is appropriate for critical applications. | 4 | Launching a service with strict, guaranteed QoS parameters, especially for critical applications, is a complex undertaking. | 4 | The intent is clear and quantitative, but the repetition of "mission-critical" is excessive and reduces readability for automation. | 5 | The intent to "launch" a "network service" with specific characteristics is a clear deployment intent. | 5 | The intent logically defines the service parameters (priority, bitrate, delay) and its purpose (supporting mission-critical apps). | 5 | All specified parameters—critical priority, GBR, strict PDB, and deterministic characteristics—are consistent and reinforce each other. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key QoS parameters for the new service. | 4.7 | A strong, technically sound deployment intent for a critical service, slightly marred by redundant phrasing. |

Linking a key rotation notification is logical but could be a separate action; however, it doesn't create a contradiction. | 4 | The intent specifies the events to monitor and priority. It could be more complete by defining the notification channel or recipient. | 4.4 | An excellent, standards-aligned notification intent that is clear, specific, and actionable. |
| 197 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 128_NEA3 encryption protocols with mission-criticalout compromising performance characteristics. | 4 | All specified technologies (5G_AKA, 128-NEA3 for ZUC) are correct. The typo "mission-criticalout" reduces the quality. | 3 | The intent names specific security protocols with a fault-tolerance requirement, indicating moderate complexity. | 4 | The intent is readable and technically correct, but the typo ("mission-criticalout") is a notable flaw. | 5 | The goal of securing infrastructure while maintaining performance is a core aspect of performance assurance. | 5 | The structure is logical: goal (secure high-performance), method (auth/encryption), and constraint (no performance compromise). | 5 | The specified components are consistent with the overall goal of a secure, high-performance system. | 3 | It specifies security protocols but lacks concrete performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) to be assured. | 4.1 | A good intent that correctly specifies security mechanisms in a performance context, but is let down by a typo and a lack of specific performance metrics. |
| 198 | Modification Intent | "Update artificial intelligence models to lstm_with high-priority_attention_mechanism achieving 90.44% prediction accuracy with high-priority multi_objective_genetic_algorithm optimization algorithms, enhancing intelligent network operations." | 4 | While the specific AI/ML models are non-standard implementation details, the concept of updating models used for network management (like in NWDAF) is valid. | 5 | This describes a highly complex modification, involving swapping out an AI model for a more advanced one and using a sophisticated optimization algorithm. | 4 | The intent is highly specific and technical, but the repeated "high-priority" is slightly redundant. | 5 | The intent to "update" an "artificial intelligence model" is a clear modification intent. | 5 | The structure is logical: action (update), target (AI models), new model spec, target metric (accuracy), optimization method, and goal. | 5 | The components—a sophisticated prediction model, an optimization algorithm, and a performance metric—are all consistent with advanced AI operations. | 4 | The intent is very complete regarding the model, but it could be more complete by stating which network function or service this model is used for. | 4.6 | An excellent, highly specific intent representing an advanced, AI-driven network operation. |
