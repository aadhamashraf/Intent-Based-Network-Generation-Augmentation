| 3 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 77 processing cores and 391GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies key modifiable parameters of a core network (processing cores, memory) and links them to an optimization goal (transport network). | 3 | This intent involves modifying multiple resource types (cores, memory) and a related domain (transport), making it a multi-faceted request. | 5 | The phrasing is direct and clearly states what to modify and for what purpose. | 5 | The description clearly outlines a modification action, perfectly aligning with the "Modification Intent" type. | 4 | The link between core resource allocation and "transport network optimization" is logical but could be more explicit about how one affects the other. | 5 | There are no contradictions. The resource modification is presented as a means to achieve the optimization goal. | 3 | The intent is clear but lacks specifics on the nature of the transport optimization (e.g., latency reduction, throughput increase). | 4.3 | A valid and practical modification intent, though it could benefit from more detailed optimization targets. |
| 4 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 41 core utilization and 443GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly uses standard terminology for network function (AMF) and performance metrics (core, memory). | 3 | This is a standard report request with specific parameters, making it moderately complex and actionable. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, well-structured, and easy to parse. | 5 | The description perfectly matches the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource consumption and provide optimization advice is a coherent and common operational task. | 5 | All parts of the sentence are consistent and support the central request for a report. | 4 | While specific on metrics, adding a time window for the data would make the request more complete for execution. | 4.6 | A standard, well-formed intent that is highly relevant for network operations and automation. |
| 5 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 498GB DDR4 memory and 5343GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | DDR4 and SATA_SSD are standard hardware terms. While not 3GPP-specific, they are fundamental to NFVI (Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure) which is contextually correct. | 3 | The intent requires evaluating two hardware components and performing a performance impact analysis, which involves simulation or modeling. | 5 | The language is precise and clearly states the components to be evaluated and the type of analysis required. | 5 | The description of an evaluation task aligns perfectly with the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The request to check hardware requirements and analyze performance impact is logical and coherent. | 5 | There are no contradictory elements; the specified memory and storage types are compatible. | 4 | The intent is clear but would be more complete if it specified the network function or workload the hardware is intended for. | 4.4 | A practical and clear intent for infrastructure planning, correctly framed as a feasibility check. |
| 6 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 399GB HBM2 memory and 1816GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard high-performance hardware terms (HBM2, NVMe_SSD) relevant to demanding NFVI platforms. Correct within the infrastructure context. | 3 | This check involves specialized hardware (HBM2), suggesting a more complex performance analysis for high-throughput or low-latency functions. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and uses correct technical terms for the hardware components. | 5 | The description to "Evaluate" and perform "impact analysis" perfectly fits the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The combination of evaluating high-speed memory and storage for performance impact is a coherent technical task. | 5 | The hardware components mentioned are compatible and relevant to a high-performance compute context. | 4 | Similar to the previous record, it lacks context on the specific network function or application workload being evaluated. | 4.4 | A well-defined feasibility check for high-performance infrastructure, demonstrating technical depth. |
| 7 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 81 processing cores and 164GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The intent correctly combines resource allocation (cores, memory) with performance constraints (execution timeout, deterministic performance), which are key concepts in mission-critical services and URLLC. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, balancing multiple competing objectives: resource allocation, a strict execution timeout, deterministic performance, and cost efficiency. | 5 | The intent is well-written, dense with technical detail, but remains clear and parsable. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification action, aligning with the intent type. | 5 | The different clauses are logically connected, describing a multi-objective optimization problem that is coherent. | 5 | All constraints (timeout, determinism, cost) are mutually relevant and form a consistent set of requirements for a complex modification. | 5 | The intent is highly specific and provides all necessary parameters for a sophisticated orchestration system to act upon. | 5.0 | An excellent, highly complex, and well-specified intent that exemplifies multi-objective optimization in networking. |
| 8 | Modification Intent | "Adjust 0.00806 packet error rate tolerance and SHALL_NOT_PREEMPT preemption capabilities, optimizing network reliability and priority handling." | 5 | Correctly uses 3GPP QoS parameters: Packet Error Rate (PER) and ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority) pre-emption capability. `SHALL_NOT_PREEMPT` is a valid value. | 4 | This intent modifies specific, low-level QoS parameters, requiring a deep understanding of traffic management and policy control, making it complex. | 5 | The language is precise, using standardized terms correctly, making it clear for a network engineer or automation tool. | 5 | The description to "Adjust" QoS parameters is a clear modification action. | 5 | Modifying PER and pre-emption to optimize reliability and priority handling is a very logical and coherent action. | 5 | The parameters are directly related to the stated goals of reliability and priority, showing strong internal consistency. | 5 | The intent provides specific values and parameters, making it complete and actionable. | 5.0 | A superb example of a precise, standards-aligned QoS modification intent.

| 9 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 16hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-4609-8819] | 4 | EAP-AKA' (EAP_AKA_Prime) is a valid 5G authentication method. NEA1 is an EPS (4G) algorithm; its use in a 5G context implies interworking. The `128_` prefix is redundant as NEA1 is inherently 128-bit. A minor inconsistency but plausible. | 4 | This intent configures a notification based on multiple complex triggers (authentication failures, security breaches) and includes a related event (key rotation). The instance ID adds a layer for tracking. | 5 | The sentence structure is clear, and the use of an instance ID at the end is good practice for machine readability. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" specific events is a perfect fit for a "Regular Notification Request". | 4 | The link between security event alerts and key rotation notifications is logical but could be more explicit (e.g., does a breach trigger rotation?). | 5 | The specified security mechanisms and events are consistent with network security monitoring. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could clarify the relationship between the alerts and the key rotation notification. | 4.4 | A good, complex security notification intent that correctly uses 3GPP terminology, despite a minor redundancy. |
| 10 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 18hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-4610-8832] | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method for 5G. 128-NEA2 refers to AES, a standard 5G encryption algorithm. All terms are correctly used. The `128_` prefix is redundant but doesn't create an error. | 4 | This intent is similar to the previous one but specifies 5G-native security mechanisms and adds a priority level, indicating its importance. | 5 | The description is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. The instance ID and priority level are clearly marked. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events aligns perfectly with the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 5 | The components—authentication, encryption, key rotation, and alerting—are all coherent parts of a security monitoring policy. | 5 | The specified 5G security mechanisms are consistent with each other and the overall goal. | 4 | The intent is actionable but could define the threshold for what constitutes a "failure" or "breach" to be more complete. | 4.7 | A strong, standards-aligned security notification intent with good complexity and clarity. |
| 11 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 64Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | All terms are correct and relevant to 3GPP RAN technology: Traditional_MIMO_4T4R (a valid antenna configuration), 3D_Beamforming, and backhaul capacity. | 4 | This intent involves modifying multiple aspects of the RAN: antenna configuration, beamforming strategy, and backhaul capacity, representing a complex, multi-domain change. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased, detailing the changes and the desired outcome ("improving coverage and performance"). | 5 | The description to "Reconfigure" antenna systems is a clear modification action. | 5 | The combination of MIMO, beamforming, and backhaul upgrades is a coherent strategy for improving RAN performance. | 5 | All elements are consistent and contribute to the stated goal of enhancing coverage and performance. | 5 | The intent is specific about the technologies and capacity target, making it complete and actionable. | 4.9 | An excellent, detailed, and technically correct RAN modification intent. |
| 12 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 438Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with 24.5ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 4 | Bitrate and latency are standard performance metrics. "Ultra-low latency" is a marketing term, but coupling it with a specific value (24.5ms) makes it a concrete technical requirement. This latency is high for 3GPP URLLC (~1ms) but is a valid target for other services. | 4 | The check requires a complex analysis considering not just the targets but also network topology and traffic patterns, implying sophisticated modeling. | 5 | The language is clear and specifies the exact parameters and context for the analysis. | 5 | The request to "Analyze... feasibility" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The request to analyze bitrate and latency feasibility in the context of topology and traffic is highly coherent. | 5 | There are no contradictions. The specified bitrate and latency are plausible targets to be checked. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary information for a thorough feasibility study. | 4.7 | A well-defined and complex feasibility check that accurately reflects a real-world network planning task. |
| 13 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 1hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-4613-8854] | 3 | 5G-AKA is correct. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect. As per 3GPP TS 33.501, NEA2 is 128-bit AES. A 256-bit algorithm exists (e.g., profiles of AES, or the ZUC-based NEA3), but `NEA2` itself is not 256-bit. This is a significant standards alignment error. | 4 | This intent configures alerts for critical security events with a very short key rotation interval (1 hour), indicating high security requirements. | 5 | The request is clearly structured and easy to parse, despite the technical inaccuracy. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" security events aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The components of the intent (authentication, encryption, key rotation alerts) are logically related. | 3 | The use of an incorrect algorithm identifier (`256_NEA2`) is a notable inconsistency with 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent is actionable, but the incorrect algorithm specification would cause failure or misconfiguration in a standards-compliant system. | 4.1 | A good security notification intent that is clear and complex, but hampered by a significant technical inaccuracy in the encryption algorithm name. |
| 14 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 105 core utilization and 418GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The use of AMF, core utilization, and memory consumption is standard and correct for network performance monitoring. | 3 | This is a standard but detailed report request, requiring analysis of specific, high-resource consumption figures. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, with specific values and a clear objective. | 5 | The description perfectly matches the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request is coherent, linking resource analysis directly to the goal of optimization recommendations. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions in the request. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but, as before, could benefit from a specified time period for the analysis. | 4.6 | A clear, standard, and actionable intent for AMF performance management. |
| 15 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 324GB HBM2 memory and 6277GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | HBM2 and Optane are valid high-performance hardware technologies relevant to NFVI. This is contextually correct. | 3 | The check involves specialized, high-performance hardware (HBM2, Optane), implying a complex analysis is needed for a specific, demanding workload. | 5 | The intent is phrased clearly and uses correct technical names for the hardware. | 5 | The description to "Evaluate... requirements" fits the "Intent Feasibility Check" type perfectly. | 5 | The request to evaluate this combination of memory and storage for performance impact is a coherent task for infrastructure planning. | 5 | The hardware components are consistent with a high-performance computing scenario. | 4 | Lacks context on the network function or workload for which this hardware is being considered, which is needed for a full analysis. | 4.4 | A specific and technically relevant feasibility intent for high-performance NFVI planning. |
| 16 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 49 processing cores and 194GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | Combines resource management (cores, memory) with performance constraints (timeout) and objectives (performance, cost), all relevant concepts in network orchestration. "Deterministic performance" from a similar previous intent is omitted, making it slightly less complex but still strong. | 5 | This is a complex multi-objective optimization problem, requiring the system to balance resource allocation, a performance constraint (timeout), and cost. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, clear, and provides specific, actionable parameters. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification action. | 5 | The components of the intent are logically linked to form a coherent multi-objective optimization goal. | 5 | There are no contradictions; all constraints and objectives are part of a consistent desired state. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the exact resource values, constraints, and optimization goals. | 5.0 | Another excellent example of a complex, multi-objective modification intent that is clear and actionable. |
| 17 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 87 x86_64 processing cores at 3.47GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly specifies a target NF (AMF), a standard CPU architecture (x86_64), and performance parameters (cores, clock speed), which are all key inputs for a VNF/CNF deployment feasibility study. | 4 | This is a complex feasibility check that requires detailed capacity planning and performance modeling for a specific network function (AMF) on a particular hardware profile. | 5 | The request is highly specific, clear, and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The description to "Assess... feasibility" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The request to check AMF deployment feasibility against specific compute resources and constraints is highly coherent. | 5 | All technical details are consistent and relevant to the feasibility assessment of a virtualized network function. | 5 | The intent provides a clear and complete set of parameters for the requested assessment. | 4.9 | An excellent, specific, and realistic feasibility check for network function deployment. |
| 18 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 5 processing cores and 206GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | Correctly specifies standard modifiable parameters (cores, memory) and constraints (timeout) for a network function or service. | 4 | While the structure is similar to previous examples, this one presents an unusual ratio of cores to memory (5 cores to 206GB), which might imply a memory-intensive, low-parallelism workload, adding a layer of complexity to the optimization. | 5 | The phrasing is clear, unambiguous, and provides all necessary values for the modification. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification action. | 5 | The request to adjust resources under timeout and cost/performance constraints is a coherent optimization task. | 5 | The elements of the intent are internally consistent, even if the resource ratio is unusual. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary parameters to be executed by an orchestrator. | 4.9 | A well-formed and complete modification intent, notable for its specific and potentially challenging resource allocation ratio. |
| 19 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 35 core utilization and 224GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | All terms are standard and correctly used. The addition of "deterministic performance" correctly scopes the analysis to metrics relevant for URLLC-type services (e.g., jitter, tail latency), beyond simple utilization. | 4 | This request is more complex than a standard performance report because it requires analysis of "deterministic performance," which involves more sophisticated metrics than average utilization. The "mission-critical" tag adds importance. | 5 | The intent is clear, well-structured, and effectively communicates the need for a specialized performance report. | 5 | The description perfectly matches the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request for a report on deterministic performance metrics for a mission-critical purpose is highly coherent. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions. All modifiers ("deterministic", "mission-critical") align to define a specific type of report. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF, the focus of the analysis, and the desired output. | 4.9 | An excellent intent that demonstrates a mature level of operational awareness by requesting analysis of deterministic performance. |
| 20 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 113 processing cores and 97GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies modifiable core network resources and links them to a "mission-critical" transport optimization goal. | 3 | A moderately complex intent involving significant resource allocation changes tied to a high-priority optimization goal. | 5 | The phrasing is direct, clear, and specifies the required changes and their purpose. | 5 | The description to "Modify core network" clearly aligns with the "Modification Intent" type. | 4 | The link between core resources and transport optimization is logical, though the specifics of the optimization are not detailed. | 5 | The elements are consistent, presenting a resource change intended to support a critical network objective. | 3 | The intent is actionable but lacks detail on the specific transport optimization goals (e.g., latency reduction by X ms, jitter target). | 4.3 | A valid and clear modification intent, though it would be stronger with more specific optimization targets. |
| 21 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 8Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 2.28ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 4 | The use of Guaranteed Bitrate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) is correct 3GPP QoS terminology. However, there is a contradiction between "low priority" and supporting "mission-critical applications" with "deterministic performance." Mission-critical services are typically high priority. | 4 | This intent describes the deployment of a service with specific QoS parameters (GBR, PDB), which is a complex task involving resource reservation and policy enforcement. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded and provides specific, machine-readable parameters for the service deployment. | 5 | The description to "Launch... network service" is a clear deployment action. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent in specifying a service with QoS guarantees. The priority contradiction slightly weakens its coherence. | 2 | There is a significant internal inconsistency between labeling the service "low priority" while also stating it supports "mission-critical applications" with "deterministic performance." | 5 | The intent provides all the necessary QoS parameters (bitrate, delay budget) for deployment. | 4.1 | A well-specified deployment intent with correct use of QoS terms, but it is flawed by a logical contradiction in its priority definition. |
| 22 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 18 processing cores and 297GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | Correctly uses standard parameters for compute resource modification (cores, memory) and performance constraints (timeout). | 5 | This is another example of a complex, multi-objective optimization problem, balancing resources, performance constraints, and cost. | 5 | The intent is very clear, well-structured, and provides specific, actionable parameters. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification action. | 5 | The components are logically linked to form a coherent set of instructions for an orchestrator. | 5 | All constraints and objectives are consistent and work together to define the desired state. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying all the necessary values and goals for the modification. | 5.0 | An excellent and complete multi-objective modification intent, consistent with other high-quality examples. |
| 23 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 336GB DDR4 memory and 4826GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms relevant to NFVI. The addition of "deterministic performance impact analysis" correctly scopes the evaluation for latency-sensitive or mission-critical workloads. | 4 | A complex check requiring analysis of high-performance storage (NVMe_PCIe4) and its impact on deterministic performance, which involves measuring metrics like tail latency and jitter. | 5 | The language is precise, clear, and effectively communicates the need for a specialized performance analysis. | 5 | The description to "Evaluate... requirements" is a perfect match for the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The request to evaluate specific hardware for its impact on deterministic performance is a coherent and valid engineering task. | 5 | The hardware specified is consistent with a system designed for high, predictable performance. | 4 | The intent is missing the context of the network function or application workload that requires this level of performance. | 4.6 | A strong and technically specific feasibility check focused on the important concept of deterministic performance. |
| 24 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent enhanced mobile broadband with mission-critical high-high-throughput data services monitoring with mission-critical LSTM_Autoencoder behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. [Instance-4624-8905] | 5 | Correctly references a 3GPP slice type (eMBB) and applies a valid, advanced monitoring concept (AI/ML-based anomaly detection using LSTM_Autoencoder). This aligns with the direction of NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function). | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, combining slice-specific monitoring, AI/ML model specification (LSTM_Autoencoder), and proactive alerting. It represents a very advanced operational capability. | 5 | The intent is dense but remains clear and well-structured. The use of "mission-critical" emphasizes its importance. | 5 | The description to "Configure... monitoring... with alerting" is a clear notification setup request. | 5 | All parts of the intent are logically connected, describing a sophisticated, closed-loop monitoring and alerting system for an eMBB slice. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions. The use of AI for anomaly detection in a high-throughput service is a consistent and modern approach. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the slice type, the monitoring goal, the AI model, and the alerting condition. | 5.0 | An outstanding, forward-looking intent that demonstrates the application of AI/ML in network operations, perfectly aligning with modern automation concepts. |
| 25 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 16hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | 5G-AKA is correct. However, `256_NEA1` is incorrect. NEA1 is the 128-bit SNOW 3G algorithm. There is no "256-bit" version of NEA1 defined in 3GPP standards. This is a factual error. | 4 | The intent configures a security alert with multiple triggers, making it reasonably complex. | 5 | The request is clearly worded and easy to understand, despite the technical inaccuracy. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" events aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The components (authentication, encryption, key rotation alerts) are logically related within a security context. | 3 | The use of a non-existent encryption algorithm (`256_NEA1`) is a significant inconsistency with 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent is actionable, but a standards-compliant system would fail to configure a check for the non-existent `256_NEA1`. | 4.1 | A clear and relevant security intent that is unfortunately undermined by a significant standards-alignment error regarding the encryption algorithm. |
| 26 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 16 core utilization and 137GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly uses standard terminology (AMF, core utilization, memory consumption) for network function monitoring. | 3 | This is a standard report request with specific parameters, making it a common and moderately complex operational task. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, providing specific values and a clear objective. | 5 | The description perfectly matches the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request is coherent, linking the analysis of resource metrics to the goal of providing optimization recommendations. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions within the request. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete with a specified time frame for the analysis. | 4.6 | A standard, well-formed, and actionable intent for AMF performance management and optimization. |
| 27 | Deployment Intent | Manage comprehensive GOLD_TIER Service Level Agreement enforcement guaranteeing 7050Mbps high-throughput performance and 29.1ms latency requirements through intelligent resource orchestration. | 5 | Correctly uses concepts like SLA, throughput, and latency, which are fundamental to service deployment and assurance. "GOLD_TIER" is a common, non-standard but understandable service level name. | 4 | This is a complex, high-level intent that implies ongoing SLA enforcement and orchestration, not just a one-time deployment. It requires a sophisticated management system. | 5 | The intent is clear and effectively communicates a business-level objective with specific technical performance targets. | 5 | While it says "Manage," the context of guaranteeing performance metrics from the start implies a deployment or activation intent. It fits well. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, linking a named service tier (GOLD_TIER) to specific performance metrics and the mechanism for achieving them (intelligent orchestration). | 5 | The specified throughput and latency values are consistent with a premium or "gold" tier service. | 4 | The intent is clear but could be more complete by specifying other SLA parameters, such as availability or packet error rate. | 4.7 | A strong, business-oriented deployment intent that translates a high-level SLA into specific, actionable technical targets. |
| 28 | Deployment Intent | "Secure multi-domain orchestration using HMAC_SHA512 key derivation functions with 256_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 6hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle." | 4 | HMAC-SHA512 is a valid cryptographic function, but it's a MAC, not a key derivation function (KDF). KDFs (like HKDF) are often based on HMACs, so it's conceptually close but not precise. Key rotation is a standard security practice. | 4 | This intent describes a complex security configuration for a multi-domain orchestrator, involving specific cryptographic functions and automated lifecycle management. | 5 | The language is technical, precise, and clearly describes the desired security configuration. | 5 | The description to "Secure... orchestration" aligns well with a deployment intent that sets up the security foundation for the system. | 5 | The components—securing orchestration, using specific crypto, and automating key rotation—are all coherent parts of a security policy. | 4 | The slight terminological inaccuracy (HMAC vs. KDF) creates a minor inconsistency. The use of a 256-bit key with a 512-bit hash function is valid but worth noting. | 4 | The intent is quite complete, specifying the algorithm, key size, and rotation interval. | 4.4 | A good, detailed security intent for an orchestration system, with only a minor technical inaccuracy in terminology. |
| 29 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with 13hours automated key management. | 5 | EAP-TLS is a valid certificate-based authentication method. 128-NEA2 (AES) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm. The intent correctly combines authentication, encryption, and key management. | 4 | This intent defines a security policy for performance assurance, which involves configuring and monitoring multiple security functions. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and uses standard security terminology correctly. | 5 | The description to "Secure performance assurance" using specific mechanisms aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The combination of authentication, encryption, and key management is a coherent strategy for securing a service. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are consistent and commonly used together. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the methods for authentication, encryption, and the key management interval. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and technically correct intent for establishing a secure performance assurance framework. |
| 30 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 17hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-TLS is correct. However, `256_NEA1` is incorrect. NEA1 (SNOW 3G) is a 128-bit algorithm, and no 256-bit version is standardized in 3GPP. This is a factual error. | 4 | This intent configures a "mission-critical" security alert with multiple triggers, implying high importance and complexity in handling. | 5 | Despite the technical error, the request is clearly phrased and its structure is easy to understand. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" events is a perfect fit for the intent type. | 5 | The elements of the intent are logically connected within a security monitoring context. | 3 | The use of a non-existent encryption algorithm (`256_NEA1`) is a significant inconsistency with 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent could be acted upon for the EAP-TLS part, but would fail on the `256_NEA1` configuration. | 4.1 | A well-structured security notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by a recurring and significant error in the naming of the encryption algorithm. |
| 31 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 104 processing cores and 375GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | Correctly specifies standard modifiable parameters (cores, memory) and constraints (timeout) for a network function or service. | 5 | This is another example of a complex, multi-objective optimization problem, balancing a large resource allocation with performance and cost constraints. | 5 | The intent is very clear, well-structured, and provides specific, actionable parameters. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification action. | 5 | The components are logically linked to form a coherent set of instructions for an orchestrator. | 5 | All constraints and objectives are consistent and work together to define the desired state. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying all the necessary values and goals for the modification. | 5.0 | An excellent and complete multi-objective modification intent, demonstrating a high level of specificity. |
| 32 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 597Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 33.1ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 4 | Uses correct QoS terms (GBR, PDB). However, it repeats the contradiction of labeling a service "low priority" while simultaneously requiring it to support "mission-critical applications" with "deterministic performance." | 4 | The intent describes the deployment of a high-bitrate service with a strict delay budget, which is a complex task for a network orchestrator. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded with specific, machine-readable parameters for QoS. | 5 | The description to "Launch... network service" is a clear deployment action. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent in defining a service with QoS guarantees. The priority contradiction slightly reduces coherence. | 2 | The internal contradiction between "low priority" and "mission-critical" is a significant logical flaw. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key QoS parameters (GBR and PDB) needed for deployment. | 4.1 | A well-specified deployment intent with correct use of QoS terminology, but it is seriously flawed by a logical contradiction in its priority assignment. |
| 33 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 317GB DDR4 memory and 4802GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | DDR4 and NVMe_PCIe4 are standard hardware terms relevant to NFVI.

| 34 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 833Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with mission-critical 31.77ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 4 | Bitrate and latency are correct terms. "Ultra-low latency" is technically a stretch for 31.77ms (3GPP URLLC is ~1ms), but using a specific value makes it a valid, albeit not "ultra-low," latency target. The "mission-critical" tag correctly highlights its importance. | 4 | This check requires a complex analysis of a high-bitrate, moderately low-latency service, factoring in network-wide conditions like topology and traffic. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased, with highly specific, machine-readable values for the performance targets. | 5 | The request to "Analyze... feasibility" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The request to analyze the feasibility of delivering a service with specific performance targets under certain network conditions is highly coherent. | 5 | There are no contradictions.

| 35 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy sophisticated HMAC_SHA256 key derivation functions utilizing 128_bit cryptographic keys with automated 20hours rotation intervals, ensuring continuous security posture and cryptographic freshness." | 4 | HMAC-SHA256 is a valid MAC. It is often used as a component in a KDF (like HKDF-SHA256), but is not a KDF itself. This is a minor terminological inaccuracy. The rest of the security practices (key size, rotation) are standard. | 4 | This intent describes the deployment of a specific and automated security mechanism, which is a complex configuration task. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, technical, and provides specific parameters for the security setup. | 5 | The description to "Deploy... key derivation functions" aligns well with the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, logically connecting the cryptographic function, key management policy, and the overall security goal. | 4 | The terminological inaccuracy (HMAC as a KDF) is a small inconsistency. Also, using a 128-bit key with a 256-bit hash function is valid but less common than using a 256-bit key. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the algorithm, key size, and rotation interval. | 4.6 | A strong and detailed security deployment intent, with only a minor inaccuracy in cryptographic terminology. |
| 36 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Beamforming_8T8R antenna systems with Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 49Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | All terms are correct and relevant to 3GPP RAN technology. `Beamforming_8T8R` is a plausible (though non-standard) name for an 8T8R antenna system with beamforming. Horizontal beamforming is a valid technique. | 4 | This is a complex RAN modification, involving changes to the antenna system, beamforming strategy, and backhaul capacity. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased, detailing the specific technical changes and their intended outcome. | 5 | The description to "Reconfigure" antenna systems is a clear modification action. | 5 | The combination of antenna system, beamforming type, and backhaul upgrade is a coherent strategy for improving RAN performance. | 5 | All elements are consistent and contribute logically to the stated goal of improving coverage and performance. | 5 | The intent is very specific about the technologies to be used and the new backhaul capacity, making it complete. | 4.9 | An excellent, detailed, and technically sound intent for RAN optimization. |
| 37 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 109 x86_64 processing cores at 2.74GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly specifies a target NF (AMF), CPU architecture, and relevant constraints for a "mission-critical" deployment requiring "deterministic performance." | 4 | This is a highly complex feasibility check, as it must evaluate not just capacity but also the ability to meet deterministic performance (e.g., low jitter) on the specified hardware. | 5 | The intent is very specific, clear, and uses standard technical terminology correctly. | 5 | The description to "Assess... feasibility" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The request to check feasibility for a mission-critical AMF with deterministic constraints is highly coherent. | 5 | All technical details are consistent and relevant for assessing a high-performance, predictable NF deployment. | 5 | The intent provides a complete set of parameters for the requested assessment. | 4.9 | An excellent, highly specific, and realistic feasibility check for a demanding network function deployment. |
| 38 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with high-priority 1 ARM64 cores and 15GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Correctly uses standard infrastructure terms (ARM64, DDR4) in the context of provisioning resources for network functions. | 2 | This is a simple resource provisioning request, specifying only core count and memory. While important, it lacks the complexity of other intents. The term '1 ARM64 cores' is slightly awkward grammatically. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, though "1 ARM64 cores" could be phrased better as "1 ARM64 core." | 5 | The description to "Provision... compute resources" aligns perfectly with the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, requesting specific compute resources for a stated purpose ("demanding network functions"). | 5 | The specified resources are consistent and form a valid request. | 3 | The intent is somewhat incomplete. It would be much stronger if it specified *which* demanding network function the resources are for. | 4.1 | A straightforward and valid resource provisioning intent, though it could be more specific and is less complex than many others. |
| 39 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 49 core utilization and 353GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly uses standard terminology (AMF, core utilization, memory consumption) for network function monitoring. | 3 | This is a standard report request with specific parameters, making it a common and moderately complex operational task. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, providing specific values and a clear objective. | 5 | The description perfectly matches the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request is coherent, linking the analysis of resource metrics to the goal of providing optimization recommendations. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions within the request. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete with a specified time frame for the analysis. | 4.6 | A standard, well-formed, and actionable intent for AMF performance management. |
| 40 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 43 core utilization and 378GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly uses standard terminology (AMF, core utilization, memory consumption) for network function monitoring. | 3 | Another standard report request with specific parameters, representing a typical operational task. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and easy to understand. | 5 | The description perfectly matches the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request is coherent, linking resource analysis to the goal of providing optimization recommendations. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions within the request. | 4 | As with similar intents, specifying a time window for the data would make it more complete. | 4.6 | A clear, standard, and actionable intent for AMF performance management and optimization. |
| 41 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-4641-8995] | 5 | Correctly identifies standard performance metrics (throughput, latency) as triggers for an alert. The concept of automated escalation is also a standard operational practice. | 4 | This intent describes a performance monitoring rule with multiple conditions (throughput drop, latency breach) and a defined response (automated escalation), making it a complex notification setup. | 5 | The intent is very clear, well-structured, and easy for both humans and automation systems to parse. The instance ID is a good addition. | 5 | The description to "Alert when..." fits the "Regular Notification Request" type perfectly. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, defining a clear cause-and-effect logic for performance monitoring and response. | 5 | The throughput and latency thresholds are consistent with performance monitoring for a high-quality service. | 4 | The intent is very good but could be more complete by specifying the exact thresholds (e.g., "drops below 1000Mbps"). It currently says "when 1000Mbps... drops," which is slightly ambiguous. | 4.7 | An excellent, practical, and clearly articulated intent for proactive performance monitoring and incident management. |
| 42 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 128_NEA1 encryption with 21hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a valid 5G authentication method. NEA1 is an EPS (4G) algorithm; its use implies interworking. The `128_` prefix is redundant but not incorrect. The combination is plausible. | 4 | This intent defines a complete security policy (authentication, encryption, key management) for a service, which is a complex configuration. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and uses standard security terminology correctly. | 5 | The description to "Secure performance assurance" aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The combination of authentication, encryption, and key management is a coherent strategy for securing a service. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are consistent and can work together in a real-world network. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the methods for authentication, encryption, and the key management interval. | 4.7 | A strong, clear, and technically correct intent for establishing a secure performance assurance framework. |

| 44 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 9hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-4644-9024] | 3 | EAP-AKA' is correct. However, `256_NEA1` is incorrect. NEA1 (SNOW 3G) is a 128-bit algorithm. This factual error impacts standards alignment. | 4 | This intent configures a security alert with multiple triggers and a specific key rotation policy, making it reasonably complex. | 5 | Despite the technical error, the request is clearly structured and its intent is easy to understand. The instance ID is helpful. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" events is a perfect fit for the intent type. | 5 | The elements of the intent are logically connected within a security monitoring context. | 3 | The use of a non-existent encryption algorithm (`256_NEA1`) is a significant inconsistency with 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent could be acted upon for the EAP-AKA' part, but would fail on the `256_NEA1` configuration. | 4.1 | A well-structured security notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by a recurring and significant error in the naming of the encryption algorithm. |
| 45 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 23hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method. NEA1 is an EPS (4G) algorithm, so its use implies interworking. The `128_` prefix is redundant. The combination is plausible. | 4 | The intent configures a security alert with multiple triggers and a specific key rotation policy, making it reasonably complex. | 5 | The request is clearly worded and easy to understand. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" events aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The components (authentication, encryption, key rotation alerts) are logically related within a security context. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are consistent and can work together. | 4 | The intent is actionable but could be more complete by defining the threshold for what constitutes a "failure" or "breach." | 4.6 | A good, clear, and technically plausible security notification intent. |

AUSF network function" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | All components of the intent are logically connected to describe a complete deployment scenario for a specific network function. | 5 | The specified hardware and software details are consistent and form a realistic deployment configuration. | 5 | The intent is exceptionally complete, providing all the key information needed to orchestrate the deployment. | 5.0 | An outstanding, highly detailed, and realistic deployment intent that serves as an excellent model for NFV/CNF orchestration. |
| 47 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications network slice implementation using Standalone_5G architecture with high-priority deployment complexity and integration requirements. | 5 | Correctly uses 3GPP terminology: URLLC (ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications is a bit verbose but correct), network slice, Standalone_5G architecture. | 5 | This is a very complex feasibility check, asking for an analysis of a URLLC slice, which is one of the most demanding 5G use cases, considering deployment complexity and integration, not just performance. | 4 | The phrasing is a bit verbose ("ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency"), but the overall intent is clear.

| 50 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 172days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 4 | Genetic Algorithm is a valid AI/ML technique. Applying it to network data for trend analysis is a concept aligned with 3GPP's NWDAF.

| 51 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 318GB DDR4 memory and 879GB Optane storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms (DDR4, Optane) relevant to NFVI.

| 56 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 7hours automated key management. | 3 | "Certificate_Based" authentication is a valid concept (e.g., EAP-TLS), but is less specific than other examples. `256_NEA2` is incorrect as NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm.

The term '1 processing cores' is slightly awkward. | 5 | The description to "Provision... resources" is a clear deployment action. | 5 | The intent is coherent, logically linking the resource provisioning to the specific characteristics of the intended workload. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions. | 4 | The intent is good but could be more complete by specifying the CPU architecture (e.g., ARM64, x86_64) or the specific edge location. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant intent for edge computing deployments, clearly stating both the resources and the optimization goal. |
| 61 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 212GB HBM2 memory and 6750GB SATA_SSD storage with mission-critical deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | HBM2 is high-performance memory. SATA_SSD is standard performance storage. Combining them for a "mission-critical deterministic performance" analysis is unusual, as one would expect NVMe storage for such a requirement. It is not incorrect, but it is an inconsistent pairing. | 4 | A complex check focused on "deterministic performance," but with a questionable combination of hardware that makes the analysis more challenging. | 5 | The language is precise and clearly states the components and the type of analysis. | 5 | The description to "Evaluate... requirements" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent, but the pairing of ultra-fast memory with standard-speed storage for a deterministic performance analysis is slightly illogical. | 3 | There is an inconsistency between the goal (deterministic performance) and the choice of storage (SATA_SSD instead of NVMe), which has much higher and more variable latency. | 4 | The intent is missing the workload context, which is crucial for such a specific feasibility check. | 4.1 | A well-phrased but technically questionable intent due to the inconsistent pairing of hardware components for the stated performance goal. |

| 67 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 290GB HBM2 memory and 6702GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | HBM2 is high-performance memory, while SATA_SSD is standard storage. Pairing them for a generic "performance impact analysis" is plausible, but less so if high I/O performance is the goal, where NVMe would be expected. | 3 | A standard feasibility check for an unusual combination of hardware components. | 5 | The language is precise and clearly states the components and the type of analysis. | 5 | The description to "Evaluate... requirements" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent, but the hardware pairing (ultra-fast memory with standard storage) might be suboptimal for many high-performance workloads, making the request slightly unusual. | 4 | The hardware combination is not inconsistent in that it will function, but it is an unbalanced configuration for many performance-sensitive applications. | 4 | The intent is missing the workload context, which would justify (or not) this specific hardware combination. | 4.1 | A well-phrased intent that is technically plausible but describes a potentially unbalanced hardware configuration, making its practical relevance questionable without more context. |

It requires a sophisticated, closed-loop orchestration system. | 5 | The intent clearly communicates a high-level business/performance goal with specific technical targets and the methods to achieve them. | 5 | While it says "Optimize," in the context of achieving targets, it strongly implies a deployment and continuous assurance intent, which is a modern interpretation. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, linking performance targets (throughput, latency) to the mechanisms needed to achieve them in a cloud-native environment. | 5 | The specified throughput and latency targets are consistent with a high-performance service. | 5 | The intent is complete as a high-level directive, providing clear targets and methods. | 5.0 | An excellent example of a modern, high-level intent focused on performance optimization and assurance in a cloud-native context. |

"high-deterministic" is a bit redundant but clear. | 4 | This is a complex intent describing a performance assurance goal with specific targets and a prescribed method for achieving them (intelligent scaling). | 4 | The phrase "ultra-low ultra-low latency" is awkwardly repetitive. "ultra-low latency" would suffice. Otherwise, the intent is clear. | 5 | The description to "Implement... networking achieving..." fits the "Performance Assurance Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, linking performance targets to a specific mechanism (CPU-based scaling) to achieve them. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the targets and the scaling methodology. | 4.7 | A strong and clear performance assurance intent, with slightly awkward phrasing being its only minor weakness. |

| 133 | Deployment Intent | "Implement comprehensive 256_NIA1 integrity protection with mission-critical FULL_PROTECTION location privacy controls throughout the orchestration process, maintaining security and compliance requirements." | 4 | `256_NIA1` is not a standard 3GPP identifier. NIA1 is the 128-bit SNOW 3G-based integrity algorithm. A 256-bit algorithm would be NIA3 (ZUC) or an AES-based one. "FULL_PROTECTION" for location privacy is a conceptual term, not a specific 3GPP parameter, but its meaning is clear. | 4 | This intent describes the deployment of a specific, mission-critical security policy covering both integrity protection and privacy, which is a complex configuration task. | 5 | Despite the technical inaccuracy, the intent is clear and effectively communicates the desired high-level security posture. | 5 | The description to "Implement... protection" is a deployment action. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking specific (though incorrectly named) security controls to the overall goals of security and compliance. | 3 | The use of a non-existent integrity algorithm identifier (`256_NIA1`) is a significant inconsistency with 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent would need correction on the algorithm name to be fully actionable by a standards-compliant system. | 4.3 | A strong conceptual security intent that is unfortunately weakened by a significant standards-alignment error in the integrity algorithm name. |

The term "intelligent insights" is vague. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying an AI/ML model, a very long-term historical analysis period, and the goal of generating predictive, trend-based alerts. | 4 | The intent is understandable but uses the vague term "intelligent insights," which could be more specific. | 5 | The description to "Alert using..." specific logic fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, describing a logical process of using an AI model on historical data to generate trend-based alerts. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions. | 4 | It would be more complete if it specified the type of trend being monitored. | 4.6 | Another strong example of an advanced, AI-driven notification intent. |
| 137 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure deterministic performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with high-priority 3hours automated key management. | 3 | 5G-AKA is correct.

The bitrate of 9220 Mbps is extremely high for a V2X message flow, which is typically small. This value is unrealistic for this 5QI. | 4 | Modifying a standardized QoS flow (5QI) is a complex operation. The unrealistic bitrate value makes it a questionable but structurally complex intent. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and uses correct terminology, apart from the name "5QI_79_V2X_Video" which is descriptive but not the standard name ("V2X messages"). | 5 | The description to "Update QoS flow" is a clear modification action. | 4 | The intent is coherent in its structure.
