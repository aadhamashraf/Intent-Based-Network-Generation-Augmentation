| 1 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 1minutes/6minutes/38minutes multi-tier escalation through Kafka notification channels with high-priority intelligent routing. | 3 | Kafka is a plausible technology but not a 3GPP-specified channel. "Intelligent routing" is a generic but relevant concept for notifications. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple parameters like escalation tiers, channel, and routing priority, giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased, concise, and easy for an engineer to understand. | 5 | The description directly requests the implementation of a notification system, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The different components (tiers, channel, routing) logically combine to form a complete notification strategy. | 5 | The elements are mutually supportive; high-priority routing aligns with a multi-tier escalation policy. | 2 | The intent is missing the crucial trigger condition for the notification, making it incomplete. | 4.0 | A well-formed but incomplete intent. It clearly specifies the notification mechanism but lacks the trigger condition. |
| 2 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps throughput deterministic performance drops below thresholds or 5ms ultra-low latency exceeds acceptable limits with mission-critical automated escalation. | 5 | The performance metrics (1 Gbps, 5ms latency) are standard targets for 5G eMBB/URLLC. The concept of "deterministic performance" is highly relevant. | 4 | The intent defines specific performance metrics, conditions (below/exceeds), and a high-level action (mission-critical escalation), making it detailed. | 5 | The sentence structure is clear and unambiguous, specifying triggers and the corresponding action logically. | 5 | The description is a direct request for an alert, perfectly aligning with the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 5 | The trigger conditions (throughput drop, latency excess) are logically linked to the action (alert and escalate). | 5 | All terms ("ultra-low latency," "mission-critical") align and describe a consistent high-performance scenario. | 4 | While specific thresholds aren't quantified, the intent provides enough detail to be actionable. | 4.7 | An excellent, specific, and standards-aligned intent that clearly defines performance-based alerting conditions. |
| 3 | Intent Report Request | Evaluate service availability metrics reporting 99.99% availability achievement and 99.9% reliability performance with trend analysis and predictive insights. | 5 | Availability and reliability are standard KPIs. The "four nines" and "three nines" values are common industry SLAs, aligning with network management standards. | 4 | The request goes beyond simple reporting by asking for advanced analytics like trend analysis and predictive insights. | 5 | The language is precise, professional, and clearly articulates the required report content. | 5 | The description directly asks to evaluate and report on metrics, which is the core function of an Intent Report Request. | 5 | The components—metrics (availability, reliability), targets, and analysis methods—form a single, coherent request for a report. | 5 | The specified metrics and analysis types are complementary and do not contradict each other. | 5 | The intent is highly complete, specifying the metrics, their target values, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | A comprehensive and well-structured reporting intent that is both standards-aligned and practical. |
| 4 | Intent Report Request | "Analyze network throughput deterministic performance comparing 1000Mbps target throughput against 5ms ultra-low latency requirements, providing insights into deterministic performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities." | 4 | Comparing throughput and latency is a standard performance analysis practice. The values are typical for 5G. The phrasing "comparing... against" is slightly awkward. | 4 | This intent requires a comparative analysis to identify bottlenecks, which is more complex than a simple metric report. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, though the relationship between comparing throughput and latency could be stated more directly. | 5 | The description asks for analysis and insights, which is a perfect fit for an Intent Report Request. | 4 | The intent is coherent, but linking a throughput target directly with a latency requirement as a comparison is slightly indirect. | 5 | The metrics are consistent with a high-performance network analysis scenario. No contradictions are present. | 5 | The intent clearly specifies what to analyze (throughput vs. latency), the goal (find bottlenecks), and the desired output (insights). | 4.4 | A strong, detailed reporting intent focused on root cause analysis, though its core comparison could be phrased more clearly. |
| 5 | Deployment Intent | Launch Airflow orchestration automation with Terraform infrastructure-as-code achieving FULLY_AUTOMATED automation level for consistent deployments. | 4 | While not 3GPP native, Airflow and Terraform are de facto standards in network automation and align with the goals of 3GPP's ZSM (Zero-touch Network and Service Management). | 4 | The intent describes the deployment of a complex automation framework using specific, industry-standard tools (IaC, orchestration). | 5 | The description is very clear to anyone familiar with modern network operations and DevOps practices. | 5 | The description requests the launch of a new capability (orchestration), which is a valid type of deployment. | 5 | The components (Airflow, Terraform, automation goal) are logically interconnected to achieve a clear objective. | 5 | Using an orchestrator with IaC tools to achieve automation is a standard and consistent pattern. | 4 | The intent is complete for its high-level, strategic nature, clearly defining the tools and goal. | 4.6 | A practical and highly relevant intent that reflects modern, real-world network automation practices. |
| 6 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 5minutes/11minutes/55minutes multi-tier escalation through Kafka notification channels with high-priority intelligent routing. | 3 | Kafka is a viable but non-standard (from a 3GPP perspective) notification channel. The escalation times seem arbitrary. | 3 | The intent is moderately complex, defining specific escalation tiers, the technology channel, and a routing mechanism. | 5 | The request is well-phrased, clear, and easy to understand for an automation engineer. | 5 | The description focuses on implementing a notification system, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | All specified elements (escalation timings, channel, routing) logically combine to describe a notification policy. | 5 | The use of high-priority routing is consistent with having a formal multi-tier escalation process. | 2 | Like record #1, this intent is critically incomplete as it fails to specify the trigger for the notification. | 4.0 | A clear and well-structured intent that is fundamentally flawed by the omission of a trigger condition. |
| 7 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 60 ARM64 processing cores at 2.76GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G NF. Specifying CPU architecture (ARM64), core count, and clock speed is a correct and detailed way to define VNF/CNF resource needs. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, providing specific hardware and performance parameters for the feasibility study. | 5 | The language is technically precise and unambiguous, making the request very clear. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "assess feasibility," which directly matches the intent type. | 5 | The parameters (cores, clock speed, performance constraints) are all relevant and coherently linked to an AMF deployment assessment. | 5 | The request for a high-priority, high-core-count system is consistent with the critical role of the AMF. | 5 | The intent provides all the necessary parameters for a resource-focused feasibility check. | 5.0 | An outstanding, technically rich, and perfectly formed intent for a feasibility assessment. |
| 8 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 58 core utilization and 272GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | AMF is a 5G NF. Reporting on CPU and memory utilization is a standard practice for managing VNFs/CNFs. | 5 | The request is for a detailed analytics report that includes specific resource metrics and optimization recommendations, making it highly complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, with specific metrics and a well-defined output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The description asks to generate a report, perfectly aligning with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The elements (AMF performance, resource metrics, optimization recommendations) are logically connected in a single reporting goal. | 5 | The term "mission-critical" is consistent with the request for detailed resource optimization for a key NF like AMF. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the subject (AMF), metrics (cores, memory), and the required output format. | 5.0 | An excellent and highly specific reporting intent that is actionable and relevant for network operations. |
| 9 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 167.28ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 2 | There is a major contradiction. A service cannot be both "low priority" and support "mission-critical applications" with "strict" delay budgets. These concepts are opposing. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple QoS parameters (GBR, PDB) and application characteristics, giving it good technical depth. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the contradictory terms make it confusing from a logical standpoint. | 5 | The description requests the launch of a service, which is a valid deployment intent. | 3 | While the parameters for a service are listed, the contradictory nature of "low priority" and "mission-critical" makes it incoherent. | 1 | The intent is fundamentally inconsistent by mixing "low priority" with "mission-critical," "strict" delay, and "deterministic" performance. | 5 | From a parameter perspective, the intent is complete (bitrate, delay budget). | 3.6 | This intent is technically detailed but critically flawed by a fundamental contradiction in its service level requirements. |
| 10 | Intent Report Request | "Analyze network high-throughput performance comparing 1000Mbps target high-throughput against 5ms latency requirements, providing insights into performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities." | 4 | The terminology is standard, but like record #4, the phrasing "comparing... against" for two different metric types (throughput and latency) is slightly imprecise. | 4 | Requesting a comparative analysis to find bottlenecks is more complex than a simple metric report. | 4 | The intent is largely clear, but the relationship between the two metrics could be defined more directly for better readability. | 5 | The request to analyze performance and provide insights is a perfect fit for a report intent. | 4 | The goal is coherent, but the method of comparing a throughput value with a latency value is not a direct comparison. | 5 | The terms "high-throughput" and low latency requirements are consistent for a performance analysis scenario. | 5 | The intent clearly defines the scope, goal (find bottlenecks), and desired output (insights), making it complete. | 4.4 | A strong intent focused on performance analysis, though its core request could be phrased more precisely. |
| 11 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze enhanced mobile broadband with mission-critical high-high-throughput data services network slice implementation using fault-tolerant Standalone_5G architecture with mission-critical deployment complexity and integration requirements. | 3 | "High-high-throughput" is redundant and awkward. "Deployment complexity" is a subject of the analysis, not a characteristic of the architecture itself in this context. | 4 | The intent involves analyzing a slice implementation against multiple factors (architecture, complexity, integration), making it quite complex. | 3 | The use of redundant terms like "high-high-throughput" and "mission-critical" twice reduces readability. | 5 | The request to "analyze" an implementation aligns well with a feasibility check. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent, linking slice type (eMBB), architecture (5G SA), and analysis criteria. | 4 | The repeated use of "mission-critical" is emphatic but stylistically inconsistent. | 4 | The intent specifies the slice, architecture, and areas to investigate, making it reasonably complete. | 3.9 | A valid but poorly worded intent. The core request is clear, but the description suffers from redundant and awkward phrasing. |
| 12 | Performance Assurance Intent | Establish cognitive performance assurance using fault-tolerant lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism neural networks with mission-critical deep learning for intelligent network optimization. | 3 | This is a collection of buzzwords. While LSTM and attention mechanisms are real ML concepts, the naming "lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism" is synthetic. The intent mixes establishing a framework with the tools to be used. | 5 | The intent describes a highly advanced, AI/ML-driven system for performance assurance, making it very complex. | 2 | The description is a dense string of technical jargon ("cognitive," "fault-tolerant," "deep learning") that harms clarity. | 5 | The goal of establishing performance assurance aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The concepts are related, but they are strung together in a way that feels more like keyword stuffing than a coherent sentence. | 4 | The term "mission-critical" is used twice, which is redundant but not strictly contradictory. | 3 | The intent is high-level and lacks specifics on what performance is being assured or what optimization is being done. | 3.6 | A highly complex and ambitious intent that is poorly readable and verges on being a "buzzword salad." |
| 13 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation monitoring with mission-critical LSTM_Autoencoder behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. | 4 | V2X is a 3GPP-defined use case. Using ML models like LSTM Autoencoders for anomaly detection is a valid and advanced technique in network monitoring. The model name is slightly synthetic. | 5 | This is a very complex intent, specifying the use case (V2X), monitoring type (anomaly detection), a specific ML model, and the action (alerting). | 4 | The sentence is long and packed with technical terms but remains grammatically correct and understandable. | 5 | The description's core request is for "proactive alerting," which is a perfect fit for a notification request. | 5 | All components—V2X monitoring, anomaly detection with a specific model, and alerting—are logically connected. | 5 | All terms ("mission-critical," "anomaly detection," "proactive alerting") are consistent with an advanced, high-stakes monitoring scenario. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the context, the condition for the alert, the detection method, and the purpose. | 4.7 | A sophisticated and well-defined intent for an advanced, AI-driven notification system in a V2X context. |
| 14 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services monitoring with Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. | 4 | eMBB is a standard 5G slice type. Isolation Forest is a valid anomaly detection algorithm. "High-high-throughput" is redundant. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the service type (eMBB), the detection algorithm, and the purpose (alerting). | 3 | The redundant phrase "high-high-throughput" and the slightly long sentence structure reduce readability. | 5 | The request for "proactive alerting" clearly aligns with the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 5 | The elements of monitoring a specific service (eMBB) using a specific algorithm (Isolation Forest) to trigger alerts are coherent. | 5 | The components are consistent with a proactive performance management scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete, defining the what (eMBB monitoring), how (Isolation Forest), and why (alert on degradation). | 4.4 | A strong and technically specific intent, slightly marred by the redundant "high-high-throughput" phrasing. |
| 15 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 101 core utilization and 384GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | AMF is a 5G NF. Reporting on CPU and memory is a standard VNF/CNF management task. The specified values are high but plausible. | 5 | The request for a report with specific metrics and detailed optimization recommendations makes this a complex task. | 5 | The description is very clear, precise, and easy to parse, both for humans and automation. | 5 | The request to "generate a comprehensive report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | All parts of the request—the subject (AMF), the metrics (cores, memory), and the output (recommendations)—are logically linked. | 5 | The "high-priority" nature of the recommendations is consistent with managing a critical network function like AMF. | 5 | This intent is fully complete, leaving no ambiguity about what is being requested. | 5.0 | An excellent, detailed, and actionable intent for resource performance reporting and optimization. |
| 16 | Intent Report Request | "Analyze network throughput performance comparing 1000Mbps target throughput against 5ms automotive-grade latency requirements, providing insights into performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities." | 4 | "Automotive-grade latency" is a valid concept in the context of C-V2X, but the comparison of throughput "against" latency is still an imprecise phrasing. | 4 | The intent requires a comparative analysis aimed at identifying bottlenecks, making it more complex than a simple data dump. | 4 | The intent is clear, but the phrasing of the comparison between two different types of metrics could be improved. | 5 | The request to analyze and provide insights is a perfect fit for the intent type. | 4 | The intent's goal is coherent, but the method (comparing throughput vs. latency) is described in a slightly awkward way. | 5 | The specified metrics (high throughput, low automotive latency) are consistent with a C-V2X performance analysis scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating the subject, the goal, and the desired output. | 4.4 | A good, specific intent for performance analysis in an automotive context, with a slight weakness in its phrasing. |
| 17 | Deployment Intent | Implement autonomous CUSTOM_METRIC scaling from 2 to 20 instances with predictive high-capacity management and cost optimization. | 4 | Autoscaling is a standard cloud-native concept, highly relevant to 5G CNFs. "CUSTOM_METRIC" is a plausible placeholder. Predictive scaling is an advanced but valid technique. | 4 | This intent describes an advanced autoscaling policy with specific instance limits, a trigger type (custom metric), and dual objectives (capacity and cost). | 5 | The language is clear and aligns with terminology commonly used in container orchestration and cloud management. | 5 | The request to "implement" a scaling mechanism is a form of service deployment or configuration, fitting the intent type. | 5 | All components—scaling action, instance range, trigger, and goals—are logically connected. | 5 | The dual goals of managing high capacity while optimizing cost are a common and consistent requirement in real-world systems. | 4 | The intent is nearly complete but would be perfect if the "CUSTOM_METRIC" were specified. | 4.6 | A very realistic and well-defined intent for implementing an advanced, predictive autoscaling policy. |
| 18 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with mission-critical automated escalation. | 5 | The performance metrics (1 Gbps throughput, 5ms latency) are standard targets for 5G services like eMBB or URLLC. | 4 | The intent defines specific performance metrics, conditions, and a response action (escalation), making it detailed. | 5 | The structure is clear and logical, specifying the trigger conditions and the resulting action. | 5 | The description is a direct request for an alert, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The trigger (performance degradation) and action (alert/escalation) are coherently linked. | 5 | The term "mission-critical" is consistent with the strict performance thresholds being monitored. | 4 | The intent is highly actionable, though the exact thresholds are not quantified. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-aligned intent for performance monitoring and alerting. |
| 19 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 180ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard performance metric. Predictive analytics and automated remediation are key concepts in ZSM and performance assurance. | 3 | The intent specifies a performance target and the methods to achieve it, giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased and easy to understand. | 5 | The goal to "optimize performance" is a core example of a Performance Assurance intent. | 5 | The target (180ms response time) is logically connected to the methods (predictive analytics, auto-remediation). | 5 | The use of "high-priority" aligns with the goal of actively optimizing a specific performance target. | 4 | The intent is complete in its goal and methods, but doesn't specify which service or application is being optimized. | 4.4 | A strong, clear intent for performance assurance, defining a specific goal and the means to achieve it. |
| 20 | Modification Intent | "Update SW_1.0.0 software version through Airflow orchestration workflow while maintaining 99.99% service availability requirements, ensuring zero-downtime upgrades." | 5 | This describes a standard software upgrade procedure for a network function or service. Specifying the availability target ("four nines") and zero-downtime constraint is best practice. | 4 | The intent involves a software update with a strict availability constraint, managed by an orchestration tool, making it a complex modification. | 5 | The description is exceptionally clear, precise, and actionable for an automation engineer. | 5 | An instruction to "update" a software version is a quintessential Modification Intent. | 5 | All components—the action (update), the means (Airflow), and the constraints (availability)—are perfectly coherent. | 5 | The goal of zero-downtime upgrades is perfectly consistent with a 99.99% availability requirement. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, specifying what to update, how to do it, and the critical constraints to be met. | 4.9 | An excellent, practical, and well-defined intent representing a real-world network operations task. |
| 21 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy intelligent edge ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications infrastructure with mission-critical DISTRIBUTED deployment strategy supporting 816749_devices_per_km2 device connectivity density, enabling ultra-low ultra-low latency applications and local data processing." | 3 | The terminology is a mix of standard and awkward. URLLC is standard, but "ultra-ultra-reliable" and "ultra-low ultra-low latency" are redundant. The device density is extremely high but plausible for massive IoT. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying a service type (URLLC), deployment strategy (distributed edge), a specific performance metric (device density), and enabling goals. | 2 | The repetitive and redundant phrasing ("ultra-ultra-", "mission-critical" twice) makes the description difficult to read and unprofessional. | 5 | The core request to "deploy infrastructure" aligns perfectly with the Deployment Intent type. | 4 | Despite the poor phrasing, the underlying concepts (URLLC at the edge for high density) are coherent. | 5 | The concepts of URLLC, edge, mission-critical, and high device density are all consistent with advanced 5G use cases. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing details on the service, strategy, and key performance requirements. | 4.1 | A technically rich and complete intent that is severely hampered by redundant and awkward wording. |
| 22 | Deployment Intent | Deploy cognitive infrastructure with mission-critical self-healing capabilities and autonomous optimization for zero-touch operations. | 4 | "Self-healing" and "autonomous optimization" are key concepts in 3GPP ZSM (Zero-touch Network and Service Management). "Cognitive infrastructure" is a common industry term for this. | 4 | The intent describes the deployment of a highly advanced, self-managing infrastructure, making it very complex. | 4 | The description uses industry buzzwords, but they are used coherently and the overall sentence is readable. | 5 | The request to "deploy cognitive infrastructure" is a clear match for the Deployment Intent type. | 5 | The capabilities listed (self-healing, autonomous optimization) are the defining features of a cognitive infrastructure. | 5 | The term "mission-critical" is consistent with the need for advanced capabilities like self-healing. | 3 | The intent is very high-level and lacks specific details, acting more as a strategic goal than an actionable command. | 4.3 | A strong, high-level strategic intent that aligns well with the future vision of network automation (ZSM). |
| 23 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. | 5 | The specified performance metrics (1 Gbps, 5ms) are standard targets for high-performance 5G services. | 3 | The intent defines the trigger conditions and a generic action (automated escalation), giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The request is phrased clearly and is easy to understand. | 5 | The description is a direct request to "alert" on a condition, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The trigger conditions (performance degradation) and the action (alert/escalate) are logically connected. | 5 | The performance metrics and the need for automated escalation are consistent with each other. | 4 | The intent is actionable, providing clear triggers, though it lacks the "mission-critical" qualifier seen in similar intents. | 4.6 | A clear, correct, and actionable intent for performance-based alerting. |
| 24 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 22hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | Certificate-based authentication is standard, but NEA1 (NAS Encryption Algorithm 1) is NULL encryption. A breach of NULL encryption is nonsensical. 256-bit NEA1 does not exist; NEAs have defined key sizes (e.g., 128-bit). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, distinct security events to monitor (auth failures, breaches, key rotation), making it complex. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the technical inaccuracies around NEA1 are confusing. | 5 | The request to "alert" on specific events is a clear notification request. | 3 | The intent combines authentication, encryption breaches, and key rotation notifications. While all security-related, they are not directly coherent. The 22-hour key rotation is a notification, not a trigger. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: NEA1 is NULL encryption and cannot be 256-bit, making a "256_NEA1 security breach" a contradictory and incorrect concept. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers (auth failure) and an event to notify on (key rotation), making it fairly complete. | 3.6 | This intent is technically flawed due to its incorrect use of 3GPP security algorithm terminology (NEA1). |
| 25 | Intent Report Request | Evaluate service availability metrics reporting 99.99% availability achievement and 99.9% reliability deterministic performance with trend analysis and predictive insights. | 4 | "Reliability deterministic performance" is an awkward and slightly redundant combination of terms. Otherwise, the metrics and analysis types are standard. | 4 | The request for a report including specific metrics and advanced analytics (trending, prediction) is complex. | 4 | The phrasing is mostly clear, but the term "reliability deterministic performance" is confusing. | 5 | The core request to "evaluate service availability metrics" is a perfect fit for a report intent. | 4 | The elements are mostly coherent, but the awkward phrasing slightly disrupts the logical flow. | 5 | The specified availability and reliability targets are consistent with high-performance service goals. | 5 | The intent clearly specifies the metrics, targets, and the type of analysis required. | 4.4 | A strong reporting intent that is slightly weakened by an awkwardly phrased performance metric. |
| 26 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 53 x86_64 processing cores at 3.18GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a 5G NF. Specifying core count, architecture (x86_64), and clock speed is a standard way to define resource requirements for a VNF/CNF. | 5 | This is a highly specific and complex intent, providing detailed hardware and performance parameters for the assessment. | 5 | The description is technically precise, clear, and unambiguous. | 5 | The request to "assess AMF deployment feasibility" directly matches the intent type. | 5 | All specified parameters are directly relevant to assessing the feasibility of deploying a compute-intensive network function. | 5 | The high core count and clock speed are consistent with the demands of a critical NF like AMF. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, providing all key parameters needed for a resource-focused feasibility check. | 5.0 | An excellent, technically detailed, and perfectly structured intent for a deployment feasibility study. |
| 27 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Establish comprehensive CUSTOM_TIER Service Level Agreement with high-priority 99.99% availability guarantee and 99.9% reliability commitment, implementing production-ready comprehensive monitoring and automated remediation capabilities." | 5 | This intent correctly uses standard concepts like SLA, availability ("four nines"), reliability, monitoring, and automated remediation. "CUSTOM_TIER" is a valid placeholder. | 5 | Describing the establishment of a complete SLA framework, including monitoring and remediation, is a highly complex intent. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, clear, and uses professional language appropriate for defining an SLA. | 5 | The goal of establishing an SLA with guarantees and enforcement mechanisms is a core Performance Assurance task. | 5 | All components (SLA tier, guarantees, monitoring, remediation) are logically interconnected to form a complete assurance framework. | 5 | The "high-priority" designation is consistent with the strict availability/reliability guarantees and "production-ready" capabilities. | 5 | The intent is very complete, defining the SLA parameters and the required implementation capabilities. | 5.0 | An outstanding and comprehensive intent that perfectly captures the requirements for establishing a service level agreement. |
| 28 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 77 core utilization and 191GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | AMF is a 5G NF, and reporting on its CPU and memory usage is a standard operational task. The values are plausible. | 5 | Requesting a report with specific metrics and detailed, actionable recommendations makes this a complex intent. | 5 | The description is clear, specific, and easy to understand for a network operator or automation system. | 5 | The request to "generate a... report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The subject (AMF), metrics (core/memory usage), and desired output (recommendations) are all coherently linked. | 5 | The request for detailed optimization is consistent with managing the performance of a critical network function. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, specifying all necessary details for the report generation. | 5.0 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for performance reporting and resource optimization. |
| 29 | Modification Intent | Monitor cross-domain changes using fault-tolerant Jaeger distributed tracing with mission-critical comprehensive impact analysis. | 3 | This sounds more like a Performance Assurance or Deployment intent. The action is "monitor," not "modify." Jaeger is a real tool for distributed tracing, but it's used for monitoring, not making changes. | 4 | Implementing distributed tracing with impact analysis across multiple domains is a complex technical task. | 4 | The sentence is readable, but its classification as a "Modification Intent" is confusing. | 1 | The description is about monitoring and analysis, not modification. There is a clear mismatch with the intent type. | 4 | The concepts of using distributed tracing (Jaeger) for impact analysis are coherent. | 5 | The terms "fault-tolerant" and "mission-critical" are consistent with the need for comprehensive cross-domain monitoring. | 4 | The intent is clear about the tool and the goal, making it reasonably complete. | 3.6 | A technically valid but misclassified intent. The description defines a monitoring/assurance task, not a modification. |
| 30 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 77 core utilization and 462GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | AMF is a 5G NF. Reporting on CPU/memory consumption is a standard VNF/CNF management practice. | 5 | This is a complex request, asking for a detailed report with specific metrics and actionable optimization recommendations. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated, specific, and easy to parse. | 5 | The request to "generate a... report" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The components—subject (AMF), metrics (core/memory), and output (recommendations)—are logically and coherently linked. | 5 | The "mission-critical" nature of the recommendations is consistent with managing a key network function like AMF. | 5 | The intent provides all the necessary details to generate the requested report. | 5.0 | An excellent, specific, and actionable intent for generating a resource optimization report. |
| 31 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate UPF deployment through nfvo_2e8a150f37b8 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_98be66928a19 VNF Manager integration. | 5 | This aligns perfectly with the ETSI NFV architecture.

However, 128_NEA1 does not exist; NEA1 is NULL encryption and has no key. An alert on a breach of NULL encryption is nonsensical. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, distinct security events to monitor (auth failure, breach, key rotation), making it complex. | 2 | The intent is readable, but the glaring technical inaccuracy about NEA1 makes it confusing and incorrect. | 5 | The core request to "alert on" specific events is a clear notification request. | 3 | The intent combines different types of security events (failures, breaches, periodic rotations) which are not directly coherent. | 1 | The intent is fundamentally inconsistent as it refers to a non-existent security algorithm (128-bit NEA1). | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers, even if one is technically impossible. | 3.0 | A critically flawed intent due to the use of non-existent and logically inconsistent 3GPP security terminology (128_NEA1). |

A "Bronze" tier should not have "mission-critical" 99.99% availability guarantees. | 5 | The intent is structurally complete, defining all the necessary components of an SLA. | 3.9 | A structurally sound intent that is critically flawed by a logical contradiction between its service tier and its service guarantees. |

The phrasing is slightly buzzword-heavy. | 4 | The intent describes a complex notification system based on ML/AI analysis of a large historical dataset. | 3 | The description feels like a string of technical concepts rather than a natural-language request, slightly harming readability. | 5 | The core request is to "alert," which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 4 | The components (GA, historical analysis, trend-based alerts) are logically connected in the context of an advanced AIOps system. | 5 | The terms "fault-tolerant," "mission-critical," and the long analysis window are consistent with a high-importance notification system. | 3 | The intent is missing the crucial information of what condition or metric is being analyzed to generate the "insight." | 4.0 | An ambitious but vague intent.

| 127 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 39 processing cores and 480GB memory allocation with high-priority transport network optimization. | 3 | The intent is vague. "Modify core network" doesn't specify which NF. "Transport network optimization" is a separate goal not directly linked to the core resource allocation. | 4 | The intent combines resource modification with a broader network optimization goal, making it complex. | 2 | The phrasing is disjointed. It's unclear if the resource modification is FOR the transport optimization or a separate action. | 5 | The intent to "modify" resources fits the type. | 2 | The two clauses of the sentence (core resource modification and transport network optimization) are not coherently linked. | 5 | The elements themselves are consistent with network operations. | 2 | The intent is very incomplete.

| 129 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 1hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is valid. NEA2 is AES, but it is a 128-bit algorithm, not 256-bit. 3GPP specifies 256-bit algorithms (e.g., ZUC), but 256-NEA2 does not exist. Automated key management is a valid concept. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple security parameters (auth, encryption, key management), making it complex. | 3 | The intent is readable but contains a factual error regarding the key size of NEA2. | 5 | The goal of securing the network with specific protocols is a valid Performance Assurance intent. | 5 | The different security mechanisms mentioned are coherently related. | 2 | The intent is inconsistent because 256-NEA2 is not a valid 3GPP algorithm; NEA2 is 128-bit. | 4 | The intent is complete in its structure, but the specified algorithm is incorrect. | 3.9 | A good intent that is undermined by a factual error in the name of the encryption algorithm. |

However, the description is cluttered with "high-priority" twice and the redundant "high-high-throughput". | 4 | The intent specifies the service, monitoring priority, a specific ML algorithm, and the alerting condition, making it complex. | 2 | The repetitive use of "high-priority" and the awkward "high-high-throughput" makes the sentence poorly readable. | 5 | The core request for "proactive alerting" is a clear match for the intent type. | 5 | The components—monitoring a service (eMBB) using an ML algorithm (Isolation Forest) to trigger alerts—are coherent. | 5 | All elements are consistent with an advanced, proactive network monitoring scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the context, detection method, and trigger condition. | 4.3 | A strong and technically specific intent that is significantly degraded by repetitive and clumsy wording. |
| 135 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_TLS authentication frameworks and 128_NEA3 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. | 4 | EAP-TLS is an authentication protocol, not a "framework." 128-NEA3 refers to the ZUC algorithm, which is a valid 128-bit 3GPP encryption standard. | 4 | The intent addresses multiple security aspects (authentication, encryption) and their impact on performance, making it complex. | 4 | The intent is readable and technically mostly correct, apart from the "frameworks" wording. | 5 | The goal of securing infrastructure while maintaining performance is a valid Performance Assurance intent. | 5 | The specified authentication and encryption protocols are coherently linked to the goal of securing infrastructure. | 5 | The components are consistent with a modern security architecture for a 5G network. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the security mechanisms and the performance constraint. | 4.6 | A good, technically correct intent for security assurance, with only a minor wording inaccuracy. |

It clearly specifies the notification mechanism but lacks the trigger condition. |
| 137 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure deterministic performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with 3hours automated key management. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method in 5G. 128-NEA2 (AES) is a standard encryption algorithm.

| 138 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation network slice implementation using fault-tolerant Non_Standalone_5G architecture with mission-critical deployment complexity and integration requirements. | 4 | V2X and 5G NSA are standard 3GPP concepts. "Deployment complexity" is a subject of the analysis, not a characteristic to be used in this context. | 4 | The analysis involves a slice type, a specific architecture, and multiple assessment criteria, making it complex. | 4 | The language is a bit dense but technically understandable. | 5 | The request to "analyze" an implementation is a good fit for a feasibility check. | 5 | The components (slice type, architecture, analysis criteria) are coherently linked to a feasibility study. | 5 | The terms "fault-tolerant" and "mission-critical" are consistent with a V2X/autonomous transportation use case. | 4 | The intent specifies the slice, architecture, and what to analyze, making it fairly complete. | 4.4 | A strong and technically valid intent for a feasibility study of a V2X slice. |
| 139 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 19hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | EAP-AKA' is valid. However, 128_NEA1 does not exist; NEA1 is NULL encryption. An alert on a breach of NULL encryption is nonsensical. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, distinct security events to monitor (auth failure, breach, key rotation), making it complex. | 2 | The intent is readable, but the glaring technical inaccuracy about NEA1 makes it confusing and incorrect. | 5 | The core request to "alert on" specific events is a clear notification request. | 3 | The intent combines different types of security events (failures, breaches, periodic rotations) which are not directly coherent. | 1 | The intent is fundamentally inconsistent as it refers to a non-existent security algorithm (128-bit NEA1). | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers, even if one is technically impossible. | 3.0 | A critically flawed intent due to the use of non-existent and logically inconsistent 3GPP security terminology (128_NEA1). |

The resource values are plausible. | 5 | The intent is complex, requiring not just a report of metrics but also detailed, mission-critical recommendations for optimization. | 5 | The description is very clear, precise, and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The request to "generate a... report" perfectly matches the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The subject (AMF), the specific metrics, and the required output (recommendations) are all logically connected. | 5 | The "mission-critical" label is consistent with managing a core network function like AMF. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, providing all the necessary information to fulfill the request. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed, and actionable intent for generating a resource optimization report. |
| 195 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network performance using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with Random_Forest predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management." | 4 | Isolation Forest is for anomaly detection. Random Forest is typically used for classification/regression, not prediction in the sense of forecasting. Using it for "predictive analytics" is plausible but not its primary use case. | 5 | This intent describes a sophisticated performance assurance system using two distinct and advanced analytical techniques. | 4 | The intent is clearly phrased, though the use of Random Forest for prediction is slightly imprecise. | 5 | The goal to "monitor network performance" and "enable proactive performance management" is a core tenet of Performance Assurance. | 4 | The use of anomaly detection is coherent, but the choice of Random Forest for prediction is slightly unconventional, affecting coherence. | 5 | The components are all consistent with an advanced, data-driven performance assurance strategy. | 4 | The intent is very clear on the "how" but doesn't specify "what" performance metrics to monitor. | 4.4 | A strong intent describing a modern AIOps approach, though the choice of Random Forest for prediction is slightly unusual. |
| 196 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 301.29ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 4 | All terms (GBR, PDB, deterministic performance) are standard QoS concepts. The latency of ~300ms is very high for anything described as "strict" or supporting "mission-critical" applications, which is a slight inconsistency. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple QoS parameters and application characteristics, giving it good technical depth. | 4 | The language is clear but repetitive with "critical priority" and "mission-critical" (3 times). | 5 | The request to "launch" a service is a clear deployment intent. | 5 | All parameters are coherently defining a network service. | 3 | There's an inconsistency between the "mission-critical" and "strict" language and the very high packet delay budget of 301ms. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the key QoS parameters for the service. | 4.3 | A well-defined intent for deploying a QoS-enabled service, but the specified performance numbers clash with the qualitative descriptors. |
| 197 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy intelligent edge massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems infrastructure with DISTRIBUTED deployment strategy supporting 399357_devices_per_km2 device massive connectivity high-density, enabling ultra-low latency applications and local data processing." | 4 | mMTC is a standard 5G service category. The device density is high and consistent with mMTC. The term "massive connectivity high-density" is redundant. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying a service type (mMTC), deployment strategy (distributed edge), a specific performance metric (device density), and enabling goals. | 4 | The intent is clear, but the redundant phrasing slightly harms readability. | 5 | The core request to "deploy infrastructure" aligns perfectly with the Deployment Intent type. | 4 | The concepts are coherent, but the phrase "enabling ultra-low latency applications" is more characteristic of URLLC than mMTC, which is a slight confusion of service types. | 4 | There's a slight inconsistency in promising ultra-low latency, a hallmark of URLLC, within an mMTC-focused deployment. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing details on the service, strategy, and key performance requirements. | 4.4 | A strong, detailed intent for an mMTC/IoT deployment that slightly confuses concepts from the URLLC service category. |
| 198 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 290ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.007296 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER) are standard 5G QoS parameters. The values are specific and plausible, though the delay is high. | 4 | The intent specifies precise QoS parameters and requires the implementation of mechanisms to meet them, making it complex. | 5 | The language is technical, precise, and clearly states the required QoS configuration. | 5 | The request to configure specific QoS parameters to assure quality is a perfect fit for this intent type. | 5 | The QoS parameters (delay, error rate) are logically linked to the implementation methods (traffic engineering, QA). | 5 | The "mission-critical" designation is consistent with the need to enforce specific, numerically-defined QoS parameters. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the exact QoS targets and the methods to achieve them. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically precise, and standards-aligned intent for QoS configuration. |
| 199 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 8 core utilization and 263GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | AMF is a 5G NF. Reporting on its CPU and memory usage is a standard operational task. The resource values are plausible. | 5 | The request is for a complex output: a detailed report with specific metrics and actionable recommendations. | 5 | The description is clear, precise, and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The request to "generate a... report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The subject (AMF), the metrics to be analyzed, and the desired output are all logically and coherently linked. | 5 | The request for detailed optimization recommendations is consistent with proactive management of a critical network function. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, leaving no ambiguity about the requested report. | 5.0 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for generating a resource optimization report. |
| 200 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 224GB LPDDR5 memory and 6616GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | LPDDR5 and NVMe SSD are specific, modern hardware standards. Evaluating their performance impact is a valid technical assessment. | 3 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying hardware components and the type of analysis needed. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and uses correct, precise technical terms. | 5 | The request to "evaluate requirements" with "impact analysis" is a perfect fit for a feasibility check. | 5 | The components (memory, storage, performance analysis) are all logically related to a hardware feasibility study. | 5 | The specified components are modern and consistent with a high-performance system evaluation. | 4 | The intent is complete in its request but lacks the context of the application or service these resources are for. | 4.6 | A clear and technically sound intent for a hardware-focused feasibility study. |
