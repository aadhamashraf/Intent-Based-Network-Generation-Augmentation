Deploying it with specific vendor software and hardware is a standard procedure in an ETSI NFV environment. | 4 | This is a highly specific deployment intent, detailing the NF, vendor, software, and a complete, modern hardware profile (DDR5, NVMe). | 5 | The intent is exceptionally clear, precise, and contains all the details needed for an orchestrator to act. | 5 | The description explicitly starts with "Deploy... PCF network function," perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The sentence is structured logically, describing the what, who, how, and on what hardware the deployment should occur. | 5 | All specified components (PCF, ZTE software, x86_64, DDR5, NVMe) are consistent and form a complete, plausible deployment blueprint for a modern NF. | 5 | This intent is fully complete, leaving no ambiguity about the required deployment parameters. | 4.9 | An outstanding example of a complete, precise, and actionable deployment intent for a specific network function. |
| 60 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent enhanced mobile broadband with high-priority high-high-throughput data services monitoring with high-priority LSTM_Autoencoder behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. | 5 | eMBB is a 3GPP service type. Using AI/ML models (like LSTM Autoencoder) for anomaly detection is aligned with advanced OAM concepts like NWDAF. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, defining a monitoring system for a specific service (eMBB) using a sophisticated, specific AI/ML model for anomaly detection. | 4 | The sentence is a bit long and has repetitive "high-priority" and "high-high-throughput" terms, which slightly impacts readability, but the technical meaning is clear. | 5 | The core action is to "Configure... monitoring with... alerting," which falls under the notification request category. | 5 | It coherently links the service to be monitored (eMBB), the method (LSTM autoencoder anomaly detection), and the action (proactive alerting). | 5 | eMBB monitoring is consistently paired with anomaly detection and alerting to maintain performance. The choice of an LSTM Autoencoder is appropriate for this task. | 5 | It specifies the service, the detection method, and the purpose, making it a complete monitoring configuration request. | 4.9 | A sophisticated and forward-looking intent for an AI-driven monitoring system, despite minor repetitive wording. |
| 61 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 79 processing cores and 376GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core and memory allocation is standard. "Transport network optimization" is a valid concept, but the intent doesn't specify *how* it relates to the compute modification. | 3 | It specifies a standard resource modification but adds a vague, unquantified secondary goal ("transport network optimization"). | 3 | The intent is clear about the compute resource change but vague on what "with transport network optimization" means in this context. It's an incomplete thought. | 5 | The request to "Modify... allocation" fits the `Modification Intent` type. | 3 | The first part about compute resources is coherent, but the second part about transport is disconnected and lacks a clear logical link. | 3 | The two parts of the intent are not necessarily consistent or inconsistent; they are just unrelated as stated, which harms the overall consistency of the command. | 3 | It is complete for the compute modification but entirely incomplete for the transport optimization part. | 3.4 | A mixed-quality intent. The first half is a clear resource modification, but the second half is vague and poorly integrated, making the overall intent ambiguous. |
| 62 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 46 x86_64 processing cores at 3.98GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard network planning task: checking if a specific high-end hardware configuration is suitable for deploying the AMF. | 3 | It is a routine feasibility check for a defined compute profile, which is a standard procedure. | 5 | The request is clear and specific, detailing the NF, core count, architecture, and clock speed to be assessed. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Assess... feasibility," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, asking to assess the feasibility of a specific component (AMF) on a specific hardware configuration. | 5 | The parameters (AMF, mission-critical, x86_64, 46 cores, 3.98GHz) are all consistent and define a plausible high-performance scenario for evaluation. | 5 | It provides all the key parameters (NF, CPU architecture, core count, speed) needed for the feasibility study. | 4.7 | A well-formed and complete intent for a common and practical feasibility check. |
| 63 | Deployment Intent | "Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 7512Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 15.5ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms." | 4 | eMBB, network slice, throughput, and latency are all standard 3GPP terms. The intent is to "Optimize," which is more of a modification or assurance goal, but it could be interpreted as deploying an optimized configuration. "high-high-throughput" is redundant. | 4 | Achieving specific, high-performance slice targets (throughput and latency) requires complex, cross-domain configuration of QoS and traffic engineering. | 4 | The intent is technically clear but slightly verbose with "high-high-throughput". The verb "Optimize" could be interpreted as modifying an existing slice rather than deploying a new one. | 4 | While it says "Optimize," the context of achieving specific performance targets for a slice can be considered a deployment or re-deployment goal. | 5 | The intent coherently links the slice type (eMBB), the performance targets (throughput, latency), and the methods to achieve them (traffic engineering, QoS). | 5 | The high throughput and low latency targets are consistent with an eMBB service slice and advanced traffic management. | 5 | It provides specific, measurable performance targets, making the goal very clear and complete. | 4.4 | A strong, technically specific intent that clearly defines performance goals for a network slice, despite slightly ambiguous phrasing of the action verb. |

However, the phrasing is slightly awkward. | 5 | This describes a very complex notification system that relies on AI-driven trend analysis over a long historical period, not just simple threshold-based alerts. | 3 | The phrasing "Alert using... intelligent insights" is a bit abstract and less direct than "Alert when..." This makes it slightly harder to parse for automation. | 5 | The core request is to set up an "Alert" or notification system, so it fits the type. | 4 | It coherently links the method (Genetic Algorithm), the data source (historical analysis), and the purpose (trend-based notifications), but the structure is slightly convoluted. | 5 | The use of a Genetic Algorithm for trend analysis and historical data is a consistent set of concepts for an advanced analytics system. | 4 | It specifies the algorithm and data retention period but is not specific about what trends or events should trigger the notification. | 4.3 | A conceptually interesting and complex intent for an advanced notification system, but its phrasing is abstract and lacks specific trigger conditions. |

| 68 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 14Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | Traditional MIMO (as opposed to Massive MIMO), 4T4R, and Horizontal Beamforming are all standard 3GPP RAN concepts. Reconfiguring them is a normal optimization activity. | 4 | This intent involves several related RAN reconfigurations, including antenna systems, beamforming, and backhaul, indicating moderate complexity. | 5 | The description is technically precise, using standard RAN terminology to clearly state the desired changes. | 5 | The action to "Reconfigure... antenna systems" is a clear modification of an existing network element. | 5 | The intent coherently links the reconfiguration of the antenna, the specific optimization technique (beamforming), and a related enhancement (backhaul). | 5 | The elements are consistent: a 4T4R MIMO system, a suitable beamforming technique, and an appropriate backhaul capacity all work together. | 5 | It specifies the antenna type, beamforming method, and target backhaul capacity, making it a complete modification request. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically precise, and standards-aligned intent for RAN optimization. |

| 72 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with high-priority 22hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication and 128-NEA3 are valid 3GPP security concepts. The ambiguous phrasing around key rotation persists. | 3 | Defines alert conditions based on two specific security procedures with high priority, requiring moderately complex monitoring. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the phrasing "with 22hours key rotation event notifications" is ambiguous, as seen in similar records. | 5 | The request to "Alert on..." security events clearly fits the notification category. | 4 | The intent coherently links security events to an alert, but the connection to the key rotation part is not fully explained. | 4 | The security terms are correct and consistent, but the overall sentence structure could be improved for clarity. | 4 | It clearly states the triggers but is slightly unclear on how the key rotation notification relates to the primary alert. | 4.1 | A relevant and standards-aligned security alert intent, with a minor readability issue in its structure. |

| 102 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 110 processing cores and 84GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core and memory allocation is standard. "Transport network optimization" is valid, but the intent fails to link the two actions, making it ambiguous. | 3 | It specifies a standard resource modification but adds a vague, unquantified secondary goal ("transport network optimization"). | 3 | The intent is clear about the compute resource change but vague on what "with transport network optimization" means in this context. It's an incomplete thought. | 5 | The request to "Modify... allocation" fits the `Modification Intent` type. | 3 | The first part about compute resources is coherent, but the second part about transport is disconnected and lacks a clear logical link. | 3 | The two parts of the intent are not necessarily consistent or inconsistent; they are just unrelated as stated, which harms the overall consistency of the command. | 3 | It is complete for the compute modification but entirely incomplete for the transport optimization part. | 3.4 | A mixed-quality intent.
