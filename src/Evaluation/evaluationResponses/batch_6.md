| 11 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 14hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method, and NEA2 is a 5G encryption algorithm. The concepts are correct, but linking an alert on failures to a key rotation *notification* is slightly awkward. | 4 | The intent combines multiple triggers (authentication failure, security breach) with a separate notification event (key rotation), making it moderately complex. | 4 | The sentence structure is slightly confusing. It seems to mix a request for alerts on security events with a notification about a scheduled event (key rotation). | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak. It's unclear if the key rotation is a response to the alerts or a separate notification event that is being configured. | 4 | The security terms are consistent, but their combination in a single notification rule is unusual. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the trigger events and the key rotation notification is ambiguous. | 3.9 | A relevant but somewhat incoherent intent that ambiguously mixes reactive alerts with scheduled notifications. |

| 13 | Deployment Intent | Optimize cloud-native performance achieving 382Mbps high-throughput targets and 46.8ms latency requirements through intelligent resource allocation and traffic optimization. | 4 | While "cloud-native performance" is a general term, the use of throughput and latency targets aligns with service deployment goals. The method ("intelligent resource allocation") is abstract. | 3 | It specifies performance targets (throughput, latency) but the "how" is very high-level. | 5 | The language is clear and expresses a clear business or operational goal. | 4 | This is more of a high-level goal than a specific deployment command. It could be interpreted as a policy to guide deployments, so it fits reasonably well. | 5 | The intent coherently links the goal (performance targets) with the means (resource/traffic optimization). | 5 | The throughput and latency targets are consistent with a performance-oriented service deployment. | 3 | The intent is incomplete for direct automation as it lacks specifics on the service, slice, or application to be optimized. | 4.1 | A good high-level intent that sets performance goals for deployments, but lacks the specificity for direct execution. |

| 15 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 53 ARM64 processing cores at 2.71GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Evaluating compute resources (ARM64 cores, frequency) for a given NF (AMF) is a standard step in NFV infrastructure planning and management. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, mentioning core count, architecture (ARM64), and clock speed. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and unambiguous. | 5 | The description to "Assess... feasibility" is a perfect fit for the intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently links the hardware specifics to the feasibility assessment of the AMF deployment. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and relevant for a feasibility check focused on CPU resources. | 4 | The intent is good but could be more complete by including expected load or performance targets for the AMF. | 4.7 | A clear, specific, and relevant intent for assessing the feasibility of deploying an AMF on ARM-based infrastructure. |
| 16 | Deployment Intent | "Coordinate high-performance compute allocation featuring 4 processing cores operating at 2.7GHz with 5375Mbps dedicated broadband allocation, ensuring consistent performance delivery." | 4 | The intent combines compute resource allocation with network resource (broadband) allocation, which is a valid, though multi-faceted, deployment action. | 4 | It specifies both compute (cores, speed) and network (bitrate) parameters, making it a moderately complex, integrated request. | 5 | The wording is clear and effectively communicates the required resource allocation. | 5 | "Coordinate... allocation" is a clear directive that falls under the "Deployment Intent" category. | 5 | The description logically combines compute and network resources to achieve a performance goal. | 5 | The specified compute and broadband resources are consistent with provisioning a high-performance service or function. | 4 | The intent is missing the target application or network function that these resources should be allocated to. | 4.6 | A strong intent for integrated resource allocation, which would be perfect if it specified the consumer of the resources. |
| 17 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 6hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-1017-8777] | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method and NEA3 (based on ZUC) is a 5G encryption algorithm. The concepts are correct, but the phrasing is slightly awkward, mixing alerts and notifications. | 4 | It defines multiple trigger conditions and a notification about a separate scheduled event, which is a complex rule. | 4 | The sentence structure is slightly confusing, as it seems to conflate a reactive alert with a periodic notification. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events fits well within the "Regular Notification Request" category. | 3 | The coherence is weak. It's unclear if the key rotation is a consequence of the alert or a completely separate event being notified. | 4 | The security terms are consistent, but their combination in a single notification rule is ambiguous. | 3 | The intent's ambiguity makes it incomplete for an automation engine to interpret without clarification. | 3.9 | A relevant but ambiguously phrased notification intent that mixes alerts on security failures with notifications about key rotation. |

| 29 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Simulated_Annealing intelligent insights with mission-critical 351days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | This intent is conceptually confused. Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm, not typically used for generating "insights" or alerts. The concept of using historical data for trend alerts is valid, however. | 4 | The intent describes a complex analytical process involving a specific algorithm and a long historical data window. | 4 | The language is clear, but the technical premise of using Simulated Annealing for generating alert insights is questionable. | 5 | The request to "Alert using... insights" fits the general purpose of a "Regular Notification Request". | 2 | The coherence is low because Simulated Annealing is an optimization method, not a data analysis or anomaly detection method for generating alerts. | 3 | The use of an optimization algorithm for generating notifications is inconsistent with its typical application. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it's unclear how the specified algorithm would produce trend-based notifications. | 3.4 | An intent with a clear goal (trend-based alerts) but a technically incoherent and questionable choice of method. |

It correctly links a 5G performance requirement (high device density for mMTC) with the performance overhead of specific security protocols (Certificate-based auth, NEA1 encryption). | 5 | It requires a complex analysis that correlates two distinct domains: RAN capacity (device density) and security processing overhead. | 5 | The language is clear and effectively describes a complex, multi-faceted performance analysis question. | 5 | The request to "Consider... impact on system performance" falls squarely under "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The intent coherently connects a use case requirement (density) with technical implementation details (security) to assess the overall impact. | 5 | The device density and security overhead are consistent factors to consider when evaluating scalability. | 5 | The intent is complete for a feasibility study, specifying the conditions and the impact to be analyzed. | 5.0 | An excellent, complex, and realistic intent for a feasibility study, correctly linking network load with security overhead. |
| 33 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 55 processing cores and 422GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | This is a standard resource modification request in an NFV environment, specifying common parameters for VNF scaling or reconfiguration. | 4 | It modifies multiple resource parameters (cores, memory) and a performance constraint (timeout), making it a detailed request. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased with specific, quantifiable values. | 5 | The verb "Adjust" clearly signals that this is a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The description logically connects the resource adjustments to the dual goals of performance and cost optimization. | 5 | The parameters (cores, memory, timeout) are consistent elements for managing application performance and resources. | 4 | The intent is very clear but is missing the name of the network function or application to be modified. | 4.7 | A clear and specific intent for resource modification that only lacks the explicit target of the change. |
| 34 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 352GB LPDDR5 memory and 1408GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | The specified hardware (LPDDR5, SATA SSD) is standard. LPDDR5 is more common in edge/mobile devices, but plausible in some server contexts. The request for evaluation is valid. | 3 | It specifies hardware types, sizes, and the type of analysis, but is a straightforward resource check. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and easy to parse. | 5 | The description's opening verb "Evaluate" makes it a perfect match for the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The intent flows logically from the resources to be evaluated to the required analysis. | 4 | SATA SSD is lower performance than NVMe; pairing it with high-performance LPDDR5 is a slightly unusual combination but not inconsistent. | 4 | The intent is clear but lacks the context of the target NF or service. | 4.3 | A good, clear intent for a hardware feasibility check, with a slightly unconventional pairing of components. |
| 35 | Modification Intent | "Update artificial intelligence models to lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism achieving 85.15% prediction accuracy with mission-critical multi_objective_genetic_algorithm optimization algorithms, enhancing intelligent network operations." | 4 | The concept of updating AI/ML models used for network operations aligns with the evolution of systems like NWDAF. The model names are stylized but represent valid concepts (LSTM, attention, genetic algorithms). | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the new model architecture, a target performance metric (accuracy), and the optimization method to be used. | 5 | Despite its complexity, the intent is well-structured and clearly articulates the desired update. | 5 | The action to "Update artificial intelligence models" is a clear "Modification Intent". | 5 | The description coherently links the model update, its performance target, and the optimization algorithm to the goal of enhancing network operations. | 5 | The components—a predictive model (LSTM), a training/optimization method (genetic algorithm), and a performance metric (accuracy)—are all consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing a detailed specification for the model update. | 4.9 | An excellent, sophisticated intent describing the modification of an AI/ML component within the network management system. |
| 36 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 62GB DDR4 memory and 1332GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | This is a standard and valid task in NFV infrastructure planning. The technologies (DDR4, NVMe PCIe4) are common in modern servers. | 3 | It specifies hardware types and sizes for a straightforward resource evaluation. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous. | 5 | The request to "Evaluate" requirements perfectly matches the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The sentence is logically structured, listing the components and the required analysis. | 5 | The specified memory and high-performance storage are a consistent pairing. | 4 | The intent is clear but lacks context, such as the NF or application these resources are intended for. | 4.6 | A clear and valid intent for a hardware feasibility check, which could be improved with more context. |
| 37 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 125 core utilization and 45GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This represents a standard operational task for managing the 5G core, specifically monitoring the AMF's resource usage. | 4 | It's a specific request, detailing the NF, the metrics, and the desired outcome (recommendations). | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and uses correct technical terminology. | 5 | The description's command to "Generate... report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, specifying the report's subject, content, and purpose. | 5 | All elements of the request are consistent and contribute to the single goal of performance reporting. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary details to be considered complete and actionable. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for generating a detailed AMF performance report. |
| 38 | Performance Assurance Intent | Establish cognitive performance assurance using lstm_with_attention_mechanism neural networks with deep learning for intelligent network optimization. [Instance-1038-8851] | 5 | This aligns with advanced concepts for network automation, such as the use of AI/ML in the NWDAF (3GPP TS 23.288). The mention of specific ML techniques (LSTM, attention) is appropriate. | 5 | This is a complex intent that specifies the use of advanced AI/ML models (neural networks, deep learning) for a high-level goal. | 5 | The intent is well-worded and clearly describes a sophisticated, AI-driven assurance strategy. | 5 | The goal to "Establish cognitive performance assurance" is a perfect fit for this intent type. | 5 | The description coherently links the use of specific ML techniques to the overall goal of intelligent optimization. | 5 | The terms "neural networks" and "deep learning" are consistent with the specified "lstm_with_attention_mechanism" model. | 5 | The intent completely describes a strategic goal, specifying the technology and its purpose. | 5.0 | An excellent strategic intent that clearly defines the goal of implementing an advanced, AI-driven performance assurance system. |
| 39 | Deployment Intent | "Ensure 100.000% service availability through MAY_PREEMPT preemption capabilities and priority-based resource allocation, maintaining performance guarantees for critical services." | 4 | The concept of preemption (MAY_PREEMPT) and priority is part of the 3GPP QoS framework (TS 23.501, ARP - Allocation and Retention Priority). 100.000% availability is an absolute, which is technically impossible, but the intent's goal is clear. | 4 | It specifies a target (availability), a mechanism (preemption), and a method (priority allocation), making it a complex policy intent. | 4 | The language is clear, though specifying "100.000%" is unrealistic; "five nines" (99.999%) is the typical standard. | 5 | The goal to "Ensure... service availability" can be interpreted as deploying a service with specific resilience characteristics. | 5 | The intent logically connects the availability target to the mechanisms required to achieve it. | 5 | The concepts of preemption and priority-based allocation are consistent with ensuring availability for critical services. | 5 | The intent is complete for defining a high-level availability policy. | 4.6 | A very strong intent for deploying a high-availability service policy, with the only minor flaw being the unrealistic "100.000%" figure. |
| 40 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS and NEA2 are correct 3GPP security terms. The intent structure, however, ambiguously mixes reactive alerts with scheduled notifications. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event, making for a complex rule. | 4 | The sentence structure is slightly confusing. It's unclear if the key rotation is a remediation for the alert or a separate notification. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguity between the security failure alerts and the key rotation notification. | 4 | The security terms are consistent with each other, but their combination in the notification rule is awkward. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the alerts and the notification is not clearly defined. | 3.9 | A relevant but poorly structured intent that conflates alerts on security failures with notifications about key rotation events. |
| 41 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. | 5 | EAP-AKA' is a primary authentication method in 5G, but NEA1 (128-bit) is inconsistent with the "256_" prefix. Assuming "256_NEA1" is a typo for NEA2 (256-bit) or 128_NEA1, the core concepts are correct. | 4 | It specifies an authentication framework and an encryption protocol, indicating good technical detail. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded and communicates a precise security policy goal. | 5 | The goal to "Secure high-performance infrastructure" is directly relevant to performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically connects security mechanisms to the goal of securing performance. | 2 | There is a significant inconsistency: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "256_". This is a direct contradiction. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but the contradictory algorithm specification makes it flawed. | 4.3 | A strong intent for defining a security policy, but it contains a critical inconsistency in the encryption algorithm specification. |
| 42 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 26 x86_64 processing cores at 3.84GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard and valid check in NFV resource planning, evaluating compute resources for a specific 5G Network Function (AMF). | 4 | The intent is technically specific, detailing the NF, core count, architecture, and clock speed. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable. | 5 | The request to "Assess... feasibility" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently links the proposed hardware specifications to the feasibility of an AMF deployment. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and relevant for a compute-focused feasibility assessment. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by including expected load or throughput targets. | 4.7 | A clear, specific, and relevant intent for assessing the feasibility of deploying an AMF on given compute resources. |
| 43 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 19hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | The concepts are valid (EAP-AKA', NEA1), but the same inconsistency as a prior record exists: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, not 256-bit. The intent structure is also ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event, making it a complex rule. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes alerts on security events with notifications about a scheduled key rotation. | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak because of the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "256_". | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the ambiguity in its logic and the error in the algorithm name. | 3.7 | An intent that is relevant in purpose but flawed by both an inconsistent technical specification (256_NEA1) and ambiguous phrasing. |
| 44 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 65 processing cores and 152GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | This represents a typical resource modification action for a VNF in an NFV environment, involving standard parameters like cores, memory, and timeouts. | 4 | It specifies changes to multiple resource types and adds a performance constraint, making it a detailed modification request. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, with specific, quantifiable values for each parameter. | 5 | The initial verb "Adjust" makes it a clear "Modification Intent". | 5 | The description logically connects the resource changes to the overarching goals of performance and cost optimization. | 5 | The specified compute resources and timeout are consistent parameters for managing an application's performance profile. | 4 | The intent is missing the name or ID of the network function or application that should be modified. | 4.7 | A clear and specific intent for modifying resources that would be perfect if it identified the target of the modification. |
| 45 | Deployment Intent | "Execute research-grade sophisticated with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated AI integration vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation network slice deployment featuring Massive_MIMO_64T64R antenna systems with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated 3D_Beamforming beamforming capabilities across 800MHz/3.5GHz/28GHz spectrum bands, optimized for Urban_Macro coverage scenarios." | 5 | This intent combines multiple advanced 5G concepts: network slicing for V2X, Massive MIMO, 3D Beamforming, multi-band operation, and specific deployment scenarios (Urban_Macro). All are valid 3GPP/5G concepts. | 5 | This is an extremely complex intent, detailing the slice type, application, RAN technologies, spectrum bands, and coverage scenario. | 2 | The readability is very poor due to excessive repetition of "research-grade sophisticated" and "mission-critical," which makes the sentence cumbersome and hard to parse. | 5 | The core request to "Execute... network slice deployment" is a clear "Deployment Intent". | 4 | The core technical concepts are coherent, but the repetitive, verbose qualifiers disrupt the logical flow. | 5 | The technical specifications (V2X slice, Massive MIMO, 3D Beamforming, spectrum bands) are all consistent and relevant to an advanced 5G deployment. | 5 | Despite the poor readability, the intent is technically very complete, providing a wealth of detail. | 4.4 | A technically rich and comprehensive deployment intent that is severely hampered by poor readability due to redundant and verbose language. |
| 46 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 11 core utilization and 429GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This is a standard and valid operational request for monitoring a 5G AMF's resource usage. | 4 | The request is specific, detailing the NF, the metrics, and the desired outcome in the form of recommendations. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and uses correct technical terminology. | 5 | The description's directive to "Generate... report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, specifying the report's subject, content, and purpose. | 5 | All elements of the request are consistent and focused on the single goal of performance reporting. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary details to be considered complete and actionable. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for generating a detailed AMF performance report. |
| 47 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 17hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | The concepts are valid (Certificate-based auth, NEA1), but the intent contains the same flaw as previous records: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, not 256-bit. The structure is also ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event, making for a complex rule. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes reactive alerts (on failures) with scheduled notifications (on key rotation). | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "256_". | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the ambiguity in its logic and the error in the algorithm name. | 3.7 | A relevant but flawed intent, undermined by an inconsistent technical specification (256_NEA1) and ambiguous phrasing. |
| 48 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 1hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is a primary 5G authentication method and 128-NEA1 is the standard 128-bit encryption algorithm. The components are correct, but the sentence structure is ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes alerts on security events with notifications about a scheduled key rotation. | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 5 | The technical terms (5G-AKA, 128-NEA1) are correct and consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the triggers and the notification is not clearly defined. | 4.1 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that ambiguously combines reactive alerts with scheduled notifications. |
| 49 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 120 x86_64 processing cores at 3.49GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard and valid check in NFV resource planning, evaluating compute resources for a specific 5G Network Function (AMF). | 4 | The intent is technically specific, detailing the NF, core count, architecture, and clock speed. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable. | 5 | The request to "Assess... feasibility" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently links the proposed hardware specifications to the feasibility of an AMF deployment. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and relevant for a compute-focused feasibility assessment. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by including expected load or throughput targets. | 4.7 | A clear, specific, and relevant intent for assessing the feasibility of deploying an AMF on given compute resources. |
| 50 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 90 processing cores and 142GB memory allocation with high-priority transport network optimization. | 4 | The intent is to modify core network resources. The second part, "transport network optimization," is a separate, high-level goal, making the connection between the two parts unclear. | 4 | It specifies a resource modification and links it to a broad optimization goal in another domain. | 4 | The intent is readable but slightly disjointed. It's unclear how changing core/memory directly achieves transport optimization. | 5 | The verb "Modify" clearly marks this as a "Modification Intent". | 2 | The coherence is low. Modifying compute resources in the core network is not a direct way to optimize the transport network; they are separate domains. | 3 | The two parts of the intent are inconsistent. One is a specific resource change, the other is a broad, unrelated goal. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't explain the relationship between the resource change and the stated goal. | 3.6 | A disjointed intent that pairs a specific core network resource modification with an unrelated high-level goal for the transport network. |
| 51 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Massive_MIMO_32T32R antenna systems with mission-critical 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 25Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | Massive MIMO, 3D Beamforming, and backhaul capacity are all standard and related concepts in 5G RAN design and optimization (3GPP TS 38 series). | 5 | This is a complex intent, specifying modifications to antenna configuration, beamforming strategy, and backhaul capacity simultaneously. | 5 | The language is technical, precise, and clearly communicates the required reconfigurations. | 5 | The verb "Reconfigure" is a clear indicator of a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The intent logically connects the RAN and backhaul modifications to the goals of improving coverage and performance. | 5 | The specified modifications (MIMO, beamforming, backhaul) are consistent and complementary actions for RAN enhancement. | 5 | The intent is complete, detailing what to change and why. | 5.0 | An excellent, technically detailed, and coherent intent for a multi-faceted RAN and backhaul modification. |
| 52 | Deployment Intent | "Secure edge deployments using fault-tolerant hardware_based_attestation hardware attestation and 256_NEA1 encryption protection, maintaining security posture in distributed edge environments." | 4 | Hardware-based attestation is a valid security concept. However, the intent again uses "256_NEA1", which is inconsistent as NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm. | 4 | It combines multiple security mechanisms (attestation, encryption) for a specific environment (edge), indicating good complexity. | 5 | The language is clear and effectively describes the security goal. | 5 | The intent to "Secure edge deployments" falls under the broad category of "Deployment Intent" as it defines security characteristics for a deployment. | 5 | The intent logically links specific security tools to the goal of securing edge environments. | 2 | There is a significant inconsistency: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "256_". | 4 | The intent is well-defined but flawed by the contradictory algorithm specification. | 4.1 | A strong intent for securing edge deployments, but it is marred by a critical inconsistency in the encryption algorithm's name. |
| 53 | Deployment Intent | "Secure high-performance communications using ENABLED SUPI concealment mechanisms and 128_NEA2 encryption protocols, maintaining security with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics." | 5 | SUPI concealment is a key privacy feature in 5G (3GPP TS 33.501). However, "128_NEA2" is an inconsistency, as NEA2 is a 256-bit algorithm. There is also a typo ("high-priorityout"). | 4 | The intent combines privacy (SUPI concealment) and confidentiality (encryption), making it a detailed security policy. | 4 | The intent is readable but contains a typo ("high-priorityout") and a technical inconsistency. | 5 | Defining security parameters for communications is a valid part of a deployment. | 5 | The intent coherently links privacy and encryption mechanisms to the goal of secure communications. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: NEA2 is a 256-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "128_". | 4 | The intent is good, but the error in the algorithm name makes it flawed. | 4.1 | A good intent specifying modern 5G security features, but it's weakened by a significant technical inconsistency (128_NEA2) and a typo. |
| 54 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Simulated_Annealing intelligent insights with mission-critical 248days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | The intent is conceptually flawed. Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm and is not suited for generating "insights" or alerts from historical data. | 4 | The intent describes a complex analytical process involving a specific (but incorrect) algorithm and a large data window. | 4 | The language is clear, but the technical premise is incorrect, which harms its overall quality. | 5 | The request to "Alert using... insights" fits the general purpose of a "Regular Notification Request". | 2 | The coherence is low because the chosen algorithm (Simulated Annealing) is not appropriate for the stated task (trend analysis for notifications). | 3 | The use of an optimization algorithm for this purpose is inconsistent with its function. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it's unclear how the algorithm would actually produce the desired notifications. | 3.4 | An intent with a clear goal but a fundamentally incorrect choice of technical method, making it incoherent. |
| 55 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade AUSF network function using Nokia SW_2.9.2 software on high-performance 3-core x86_64 architecture with 14GB DDR4 memory and 79GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | The intent correctly identifies AUSF as a 5G core NF and specifies a complete and plausible set of deployment parameters (vendor, software, compute, memory, storage). | 5 | This is a highly detailed intent, specifying the NF, software version, and a full slate of hardware resources. | 5 | The sentence is well-constructed and clearly specifies all necessary deployment parameters. | 5 | The initial action "Deploy... AUSF network function" is a perfect "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The description is logically coherent, detailing all components required for a specific NF deployment. | 5 | All specified parameters are consistent with deploying a virtualized network function. | 5 | This is a very complete intent, providing a rich set of parameters for an orchestrator. | 5.0 | A comprehensive and exceptionally well-defined deployment intent, suitable for a sophisticated automation system. |

| 58 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | The concepts are valid (EAP-TLS, NEA1), but the intent contains the recurring flaw: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, not 256-bit. The sentence structure is also ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event, making for a complex rule. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes reactive alerts (on failures) with scheduled notifications (on key rotation). | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "256_". | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the ambiguity in its logic and the error in the algorithm name. | 3.7 | A relevant but flawed intent, undermined by an inconsistent technical specification (256_NEA1) and ambiguous phrasing. |

DDR4 and SATA SSD are standard components. | 3 | It specifies hardware types, sizes, and the type of analysis, but is a straightforward resource check. | 5 | The language is clear, technical, and easily understood. | 5 | The opening verb "Evaluate" makes the description a perfect match for the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The intent flows logically from the resources being checked to the required analysis. | 4 | Pairing a large amount of RAM with lower-performance SATA SSD for a "deterministic performance" analysis is slightly unusual, but not impossible. | 4 | The intent is clear but lacks the context of the NF or service these resources would support. | 4.4 | A good and clear intent for a hardware feasibility study, though the hardware combination is not optimal for high performance. |
| 60 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 381Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with 20.67ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 5 | This is an excellent feasibility check for a network service, correctly identifying bitrate and latency as key KPIs and topology/traffic as key influencing factors.

| 68 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 16hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA and 128-NEA3 (ZUC) are correct and consistent 5G security terms. The sentence structure, however, remains ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes alerts on security events with notifications about a scheduled key rotation. | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 5 | The technical terms (5G-AKA, 128-NEA3) are correct and consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the triggers and the notification is not clearly defined. | 4.1 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that ambiguously combines reactive alerts with scheduled notifications. |
| 69 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 123.41ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | This intent correctly uses 3GPP QoS parameters like Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) (TS 23.501) to define a service. The PDB is quite high for a "critical" service, but technically valid. | 5 | It specifies multiple precise QoS parameters with "mission-critical" qualifiers, defining a complex and high-priority service. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, with specific, quantifiable performance targets and priorities. | 5 | The action to "Launch... network service" with defined characteristics is a quintessential "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The description logically connects the service launch to its specific, stringent performance requirements. | 4 | The GBR is low (1Mbps) while the PDB is high (123.41ms).

| 71 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Particle_Swarm intelligent insights with mission-critical 158days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | The intent is conceptually flawed. Particle Swarm Optimization is an optimization algorithm, not a method for generating "insights" or detecting trends for alerts. | 4 | The intent describes a complex analytical process involving a specific (but incorrect) algorithm and a large data window. | 4 | The language is clear, but the technical premise of using Particle Swarm for generating alerts is incorrect. | 5 | The request to "Alert using... insights" fits the general purpose of a "Regular Notification Request". | 2 | The coherence is low because the chosen algorithm (Particle Swarm) is not appropriate for the stated task (trend analysis for notifications). | 3 | The use of an optimization algorithm for this purpose is inconsistent with its function. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it's unclear how the algorithm would actually produce the desired notifications. | 3.4 | An intent with a clear goal but a fundamentally incorrect choice of technical method, making it incoherent. |

| 77 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 19hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | The concepts are valid (EAP-TLS, NEA1), but the intent contains the recurring flaw: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, not 256-bit. The sentence structure is also ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event, making for a complex rule. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes reactive alerts (on failures) with scheduled notifications (on key rotation). | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "256_". | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the ambiguity in its logic and the error in the algorithm name. | 3.7 | A relevant but flawed intent, undermined by an inconsistent technical specification (256_NEA1) and ambiguous phrasing. |

[Instance-1097-9096] | 5 | This is a classic performance monitoring alert, specifying clear KPIs (throughput, latency), thresholds, and a response. This is a perfect example of this intent type. | 4 | It defines a rule with two trigger conditions and a specific action, making it a well-defined and moderately complex alert. | 5 | The intent is exceptionally clear, specific, and easy to parse. | 5 | The request to "Alert when..." fits the "Regular Notification Request" type perfectly. | 5 | The sentence coherently defines the conditions for the alert and the action to be taken. | 5 | The throughput and latency metrics are consistent and standard for performance monitoring. | 4 | The intent is nearly perfect but could be improved by specifying which service or slice the thresholds apply to. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for setting up performance-based alerting. |
| 98 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-AKA' and 256-NEA2 are correct and consistent 5G security terms. The sentence structure, however, remains ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes alerts on security events with notifications about a scheduled key rotation. | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 5 | The technical terms (EAP-AKA', 256-NEA2) are correct and consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the triggers and the notification is not clearly defined. | 4.1 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that ambiguously combines reactive alerts with scheduled notifications. |
| 99 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 3hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-AKA' and 256-NEA2 are correct and consistent 5G security terms.

| 101 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 2Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 1.11ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | The intent correctly uses 3GPP QoS parameters like GBR and PDB. | 4 | It specifies precise QoS parameters for a service deployment. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated with quantifiable targets. | 5 | The action "Launch... network service" is a clear "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The description logically connects the service launch to its performance characteristics. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: the service is "low priority" but has a "strict 1.11ms packet delay budget" and supports "mission-critical applications." These attributes are contradictory. URLLC (ultra-low latency) is by definition high priority. | 5 | The intent is complete in its specification, despite the contradiction. | 4.4 | A well-specified but fundamentally inconsistent intent that mixes "low priority" with "mission-critical" and "ultra-low latency" requirements. |

| 105 | Modification Intent | "Update QoS flow 5QI_80_Low_Latency_eMBB configuration with 6780Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality." | 4 | 5QI (5G QoS Identifier) is a standard 3GPP concept (TS 23.501). However, 5QI values are standardized, and there is no "5QI_80_Low_Latency_eMBB". Standardized values are integers (e.g., 1-9 for GBR, 80 for specific services). The name is descriptive but not standard. | 4 | It modifies a specific QoS parameter (maximum bitrate) for a defined traffic class, making it a detailed policy update. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, even if the 5QI name is non-standard. | 5 | The verb "Update" clearly identifies this as a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The intent logically links the configuration change to the desired outcomes (enhanced traffic handling, user experience). | 4 | The intent is internally consistent, but the use of a non-standard 5QI name is a mild standards alignment issue. | 5 | The intent is complete for its stated purpose. | 4.6 | A very good intent for modifying QoS parameters, slightly weakened by the use of a descriptive but non-standard 5QI name. |

| 108 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. However, the intent again uses "256_NEA1", which is inconsistent as NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm. | 4 | It combines multiple security mechanisms for a high-performance goal. | 5 | The language is clear and effectively describes the security goal. | 5 | The intent to "Secure... infrastructure" falls under "Performance Assurance Intent". | 5 | The intent logically links specific security tools to the goal of securing infrastructure. | 2 | There is a significant inconsistency: NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, but it is prefixed with "256_". | 4 | The intent is well-defined but flawed by the contradictory algorithm specification. | 4.1 | A strong intent for securing infrastructure, but it is marred by a critical inconsistency in the encryption algorithm's name. |
| 109 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 77 processing cores and 304GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | The intent is to modify core network resources. The second part, "transport network optimization," is a separate, high-level goal, making the connection between the two parts unclear. | 4 | It specifies a resource modification and links it to a broad optimization goal in another domain. | 4 | The intent is readable but slightly disjointed. It's unclear how changing core/memory directly achieves transport optimization. | 5 | The verb "Modify" clearly marks this as a "Modification Intent". | 2 | The coherence is low. Modifying compute resources in the core network is not a direct way to optimize the transport network; they are separate domains. | 3 | The two parts of the intent are inconsistent. One is a specific resource change, the other is a broad, unrelated goal. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't explain the relationship between the resource change and the stated goal. | 3.6 | A disjointed intent that pairs a specific core network resource modification with an unrelated high-level goal for the transport network. |
| 110 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 24hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-1110-9183] | 5 | 5G-AKA and 128-NEA3 (ZUC) are correct and consistent 5G security terms. The sentence structure, however, remains ambiguous. | 4 | It combines multiple event triggers with a notification about a separate periodic event. | 4 | The phrasing ambiguously mixes alerts on security events with notifications about a scheduled key rotation. | 5 | The command to "Alert on" fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the ambiguous link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification. | 5 | The technical terms (5G-AKA, 128-NEA3) are correct and consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the triggers and the notification is not clearly defined. | 4.1 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that ambiguously combines reactive alerts with scheduled notifications. |

This is a minor terminological inconsistency. | 5 | The intent is complete for a service feasibility study. | 4.9 | An excellent intent for a service feasibility study, with a minor inconsistency in the use of the term "ultra-low latency." |

| 120 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 411813_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and EAP_TLS/256_NEA2 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 5 | This is a valid and complex feasibility check, correctly linking a 5G mMTC requirement (device density) with the performance overhead of specific, correctly named security protocols (EAP-TLS, 256-NEA2). | 5 | It requires a complex analysis correlating RAN capacity with security processing overhead. | 5 | The language is clear and effectively describes a complex, multi-faceted performance analysis question. | 5 | The request to "Consider... impact on system performance" falls squarely under "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The intent coherently connects a use case requirement (density) with technical implementation details (security) to assess the overall impact. | 5 | The device density and security overhead are consistent factors to consider when evaluating scalability. | 5 | The intent is complete for a feasibility study, specifying the conditions and the impact to be analyzed. | 5.0 | An excellent, complex, and realistic intent for a feasibility study, correctly linking network load with security overhead. |
| 121 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 71days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | The intent is conceptually flawed. Genetic Algorithm is an optimization/search algorithm, not a method for generating "insights" or detecting trends for alerts. | 4 | The intent describes a complex analytical process involving a specific (but incorrect) algorithm and a large data window. | 4 | The language is clear, but the technical premise of using a Genetic Algorithm for generating alerts is incorrect. | 5 | The request to "Alert using... insights" fits the general purpose of a "Regular Notification Request". | 2 | The coherence is low because the chosen algorithm (Genetic Algorithm) is not appropriate for the stated task (trend analysis for notifications). | 3 | The use of an optimization algorithm for this purpose is inconsistent with its function. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it's unclear how the algorithm would actually produce the desired notifications. | 3.4 | An intent with a clear goal but a fundamentally incorrect choice of technical method, making it incoherent. |

[Instance-1164-9434] | 4 | The performance targets (throughput, latency) are standard. Using CPU-based scaling is a valid mechanism, but its direct link to achieving network latency/throughput targets is indirect; it scales the functions that process the traffic, not the network itself. | 4 | It sets specific performance targets and links them to a specific (if indirect) autoscaling mechanism. | 4 | The intent is clear, but the phrase "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant. | 5 | The goal to "Implement high-performance networking" is a clear "Performance Assurance Intent". | 3 | The coherence is moderate.
