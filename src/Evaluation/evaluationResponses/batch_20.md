The phrase "transport network optimization" is slightly vague but plausibly related. | 3 | The intent specifies changes to two key resources (cores, memory) and links it to another domain (transport network), indicating moderate complexity. | 3 | The phrase "with transport network optimization" is slightly ambiguous. Does it mean "for" or "in addition to"? | 5 | The description clearly states an intent to "Modify" resources. | 4 | The primary action (modify compute resources) is clear, but its connection to transport optimization is not fully elaborated. | 4 | Modifying compute for the core network is consistent. The link to transport optimization is plausible but could be a separate, coordinated action. | 3 | The intent is somewhat incomplete as it doesn't specify which NFs are affected by the resource change. | 3.7 | A plausible intent, but its clarity and completeness could be improved by specifying the target NFs and clarifying the relationship to transport optimization. |
