| 4 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 41 ARM64 processing cores at 2.36GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a highly realistic feasibility check. AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) is a key 5G core NF, and assessing its deployment on specific hardware (ARM64) is a standard procedure. | 4 | The intent includes specific details like NF type (AMF), core count, architecture (ARM64), and clock speed, making it technically specific. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated and easy to parse, making it suitable for automation. | 5 | "Assess AMF deployment feasibility" directly matches the Intent Feasibility Check type. | 5 | The structure is logical, specifying the target (AMF deployment), the conditions (hardware), and the criteria (requirements/constraints). | 5 | The elements are consistent; assessing an NF's deployment on a specific CPU architecture is a coherent task. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing all necessary information for a targeted feasibility study. | 5.0 | An excellent, realistic, and well-formed feasibility check intent that aligns perfectly with 5G network deployment practices. |
| 5 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 481ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This aligns with 3GPP concepts of closed-loop automation and performance management (e.g., NWDAF). The specific response time target is a common SLA/SLO parameter. | 4 | It combines a specific performance target (481ms response time) with advanced methods (predictive analytics, automated remediation), indicating a complex goal. | 5 | The language is clear and concise, effectively communicating the performance goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description "Optimize performance achieving..." is a direct expression of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects a desired outcome (low response time) with the methods to ensure it. | 5 | The components are consistent; predictive analytics and automated remediation are tools used to achieve and maintain performance targets. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying the service or application for which this response time is targeted. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant performance assurance intent that captures the essence of modern, automated network management. |
| 6 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous deterministic performance optimization using fault-tolerant lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism machine learning models with mission-critical 86.65% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 4 | This aligns with the vision of Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) and 3GPP's NWDAF, which leverage ML for network automation. The ML model name is synthetic but plausible. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying the use of specific ML models, fault tolerance, a precise accuracy target, and the overarching goal of autonomous optimization. | 4 | While technically dense, the intent is readable for a subject matter expert. The long model name slightly hinders readability. | 5 | "Implement autonomous deterministic performance optimization" clearly falls under the Performance Assurance category. | 4 | The sentence structure is a bit convoluted but coherent, linking the implementation of an ML model to a performance goal. | 5 | The elements are consistent: an ML model with high accuracy is a prerequisite for reliable autonomous network management. | 5 | This is a very complete intent, specifying the method (ML model), its characteristics (fault-tolerant), its performance target (accuracy), and its purpose. | 4.6 | A sophisticated and forward-looking performance assurance intent that exemplifies the use of AI/ML in network operations. |
| 7 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network deterministic performance using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with Random_Forest predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive deterministic performance management." | 5 | This strongly aligns with 3GPP's NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function) which uses ML for anomaly detection and predictive analytics (TS 23.288). The mentioned algorithms are standard and appropriate for these tasks. | 5 | The intent is complex, referencing two distinct machine learning models (Isolation Forest for anomalies, Random Forest for prediction) and applying them to proactive performance management. | 5 | The description is clear and well-structured, making it easy to understand the monitoring and analytics strategy. | 5 | "Monitor network... performance... enabling proactive... management" is a core example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects monitoring tools (ML models) to a desired outcome (proactive management). | 5 | The use of Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and Random Forest for prediction is a consistent and valid data science approach. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the goal, the methods, and the rationale. | 5.0 | An excellent and highly relevant intent that accurately reflects how modern AI/ML techniques are applied for performance assurance in 5G networks. |
| 8 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | The terms are correct: EAP-TLS is an authentication protocol (RFC 5216), and 128-NEA1 is a valid 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). Key rotation is a standard security practice. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security event triggers (authentication failure, encryption breach, key rotation) into a single notification rule. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It's unclear if it's three separate alerts or if the key rotation notification is linked to the other events. | 5 | "Alert on..." is a clear and direct match for a Regular Notification Request. | 3 | The coherence is slightly weak due to the ambiguous connection between the failure/breach alerts and the key rotation notification. | 4 | While the components are all related to security, their combination in one sentence could imply a potentially inconsistent workflow if not clarified. | 4 | It specifies the trigger conditions and priority. It could be more complete by defining the notification channel. | 3.9 | A valid notification intent using correct 3GPP security terms, but its structure could be improved for clarity. |
| 9 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 293GB DDR5 memory and 9826GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with mission-critical deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is a valid feasibility check for high-performance hardware (DDR5, NVMe PCIe4) required for mission-critical services, aligning with NFV infrastructure planning. | 4 | The intent specifies modern, high-end hardware and links it to a complex requirement ("mission-critical deterministic performance"), adding to its complexity. | 5 | The description is clearly written and easy to understand. | 5 | "Evaluate memory and storage requirements" is a perfect fit for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The structure is logical: evaluate [hardware] with [analysis type]. | 5 | The specified high-performance hardware is consistent with the need for a "mission-critical deterministic performance" analysis. | 3 | Similar to other hardware checks, it lacks the context of the NF or service being evaluated, which is a key missing piece. | 4.4 | A strong feasibility check for high-performance infrastructure, though it would be more actionable with a specified workload. |
| 10 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with 12hours automated key management. | 5 | The components are standard: Certificate-Based authentication is widely used, 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G) is a 3GPP-specified cipher (TS 33.501), and automated key management is a best practice. | 4 | It combines three distinct security functions (authentication, encryption, key management) into a single assurance policy. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated and easy to parse. | 5 | "Secure performance assurance" is a direct statement of a Performance Assurance Intent, focusing on the security dimension. | 5 | The intent logically groups together related security mechanisms to form a comprehensive security policy. | 5 | The chosen mechanisms for authentication, encryption, and key management are consistent and complementary. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the methods for authentication and encryption, and the policy for key management. | 4.9 | An excellent, coherent, and technically correct intent that defines a clear security posture for performance assurance. |
| 11 | Deployment Intent | "Orchestrate comprehensive UDM deployment through coordinated nfvo_abda482dbe0d Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_65976722bd52 VNF Manager interaction, ensuring seamless lifecycle management and resource optimization." | 5 | This perfectly describes the standard ETSI NFV MANO architecture, where the NFVO and VNFM collaborate to deploy NFs like the UDM (Unified Data Management). The IDs are synthetic but represent a valid concept. | 5 | The intent is highly complex as it describes the interaction between two core orchestration components (NFVO, VNFM) for a specific NF (UDM) and includes high-level goals (lifecycle management, resource optimization). | 5 | Despite its complexity, the description is very clear and accurately portrays the orchestration process. | 5 | "Orchestrate comprehensive UDM deployment" is a clear and precise Deployment Intent. | 5 | The description of the orchestration workflow is logical and correct according to NFV standards. | 5 | The roles described for the NFVO and VNFM are consistent with their standardized functions. | 5 | This is a very complete intent, specifying the NF, the orchestrating entities, and the high-level objectives of the deployment. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a deployment intent, accurately reflecting the standardized architecture and process of NFV orchestration. |
| 12 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with 2hours automated key management. | 5 | This is incorrect. 3GPP TS 33.501 specifies 128-bit keys for NEA1 (AES). While AES supports 256-bit keys, 3GPP's usage for NEA1 is 128-bit. This is a subtle but important error. | 4 | The intent combines authentication, encryption, and key management policy into a single statement. | 5 | The description is clear and easy to understand. | 5 | "Secure performance assurance" clearly states the intent's purpose, fitting the Performance Assurance category. | 5 | The components are logically grouped to define a security policy. | 2 | There is a standards-based inconsistency: 3GPP's NEA1 is defined with a 128-bit key, not 256-bit. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the security mechanisms and policies. | 4.4 | A well-structured intent that is almost perfect but contains a significant error regarding the key length for the 3GPP NEA1 algorithm. |
| 13 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 26 processing cores and 256GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | Aligns with standard resource management functions in an orchestrated environment (e.g., ETSI NFV MANO). The concepts are valid and relevant. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, precise parameters for adjustment (cores, memory, timeout) and links them to optimization goals. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased, making it easily understandable and actionable for an automation system. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a direct match for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The structure is logical: action, parameters, and goals are clearly laid out. | 5 | The desire to adjust resources to optimize performance and cost is a consistent and common operational goal. | 4 | The intent is quite complete but would be improved by specifying the target NF or service. | 4.6 | A well-formed and specific modification intent, suitable for automated resource management systems. |
| 14 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with mission-critical 19hours automated key management. | 5 | All components are correct and aligned with 3GPP standards. 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method in 5G (TS 33.501), and 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G) is a standard cipher. | 4 | It combines three critical security aspects: authentication (5G-AKA), encryption (128-NEA2), and key management, along with fault-tolerance and priority. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, with all technical terms used correctly and in a logical sequence. | 5 | This is a clear Performance Assurance Intent with a focus on securing the network. | 5 | The intent coherently bundles authentication, encryption, and key management into a single security policy. | 5 | All elements are consistent with creating a secure and resilient 5G communication environment. | 5 | This is a complete intent that specifies the what (security mechanisms) and how (fault-tolerant, automated key management). | 4.9 | An excellent, technically accurate, and comprehensive intent for establishing a secure performance assurance policy in a 5G network. |
| 15 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with high-priority 5hours automated key management. | 2 | This is incorrect. 3GPP TS 33.501 specifies a 128-bit key for NEA2 (SNOW 3G). A 256-bit version is not defined in the standard. | 4 | The intent combines authentication, encryption, and key management policy, making it a comprehensive security statement. | 5 | The description is clearly written and easy to parse. | 5 | "Secure performance assurance" directly communicates the intent's goal. | 5 | The intent logically groups together the core components of a security policy. | 2 | The use of "256_NEA2" is inconsistent with 3GPP standards, which define NEA2 with a 128-bit key. | 5 | It's a complete definition of a security policy, despite the technical error. | 4.0 | A well-structured intent that is undermined by a significant technical inaccuracy regarding the key length of the NEA2 encryption algorithm. |
| 16 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 74 processing cores and 411GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | This aligns with standard orchestration capabilities for modifying NF resources based on performance and cost objectives, as seen in ETSI NFV MANO. | 4 | It provides specific numerical values for cores, memory, and timeout, and links them to dual optimization goals, giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The sentence is well-constructed, clear, and unambiguous for both human operators and automation engines. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a quintessential Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent follows a logical structure: command, parameters, and desired outcomes. | 5 | The parameters are consistent with the stated goals of optimizing performance and cost efficiency. | 4 | The intent is actionable and specific, but lacks the context of which NF or service is being modified. | 4.6 | A clear and well-defined modification intent, perfectly suited for dynamic resource management scenarios. |
| 17 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 92 core utilization and 471GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This is a highly realistic request. Analyzing resource utilization (CPU, memory) of an AMF and providing optimization recommendations is a key task for network management and analytics functions like NWDAF. | 5 | The request is complex, asking not just for data (core/memory usage) but also for analytics (patterns) and prescriptive output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | The language is precise and clearly outlines the requirements for the report. | 5 | "Generate... report" is a direct match for an Intent Report Request. | 5 | The intent is coherent, progressing logically from data points (utilization) to analysis (patterns) and finally to recommendations. | 5 | All parts of the request are consistent and build upon each other to define a valuable analytics task. | 5 | This is a very complete request, specifying the NF (AMF), the metrics, the type of analysis, and the desired output. | 5.0 | An excellent and practical example of a report request, reflecting a sophisticated, analytics-driven approach to network management. |
| 18 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 81 processing cores and 271GB memory allocation with high-priority 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | The intent is consistent with the principles of dynamic resource allocation in virtualized network environments (ETSI NFV). The specified parameters are plausible. | 4 | It specifies multiple precise resource parameters and connects them to the dual objectives of performance and cost, giving it a good level of detail. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and easily parsible, making it ideal for automation. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" clearly identifies this as a Modification Intent. | 5 | The structure is logical and follows a command-parameter-goal format. | 5 | The specified adjustments are consistent with the goal of performance and cost optimization. | 4 | The intent is complete in what it asks for, but would be more useful if it specified the target NF. | 4.6 | A standard and well-formed modification intent, providing clear, actionable parameters for resource orchestration. |
| 19 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 669196_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and EAP_TLS/256_NEA1 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 2 | This contains a standards error. 3GPP's NEA1 algorithm is 128-bit, not 256-bit. EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method. High-density support is a valid 5G concept (mMTC). | 5 | The intent is highly complex, requiring an analysis that correlates device density (a network parameter) with security overhead (a computational parameter) and its impact on system-level performance. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the combination of very specific metrics makes it dense. | 5 | "Consider... impact on system performance and scalability" is a clear feasibility check. | 5 | It coherently links network conditions (density) with security protocols and their systemic impact. | 2 | The use of "256_NEA1" is inconsistent with the 3GPP standard for the NEA1 algorithm, creating a technical contradiction. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the conditions (density, security) and the evaluation criteria (performance, scalability). | 4.0 | A complex and relevant feasibility check that is unfortunately flawed by a significant error in the specified encryption algorithm. |
| 20 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 38 core utilization and 502GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This is a realistic and valuable request, aligning with the operational needs for managing a 5G AMF. It reflects the kind of analytics expected from a function like NWDAF. | 5 | The request is complex as it goes beyond simple data reporting to require analysis of patterns and generation of "mission-critical" recommendations. | 5 | The description is clear, precise, and unambiguous. | 5 | "Generate... report" is a clear-cut Intent Report Request. | 5 | The request is very coherent, building from metrics to patterns to actionable recommendations. | 5 | All elements are consistent and contribute to a single, well-defined analytics goal. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the priority, and the desired output format (detailed recommendations). | 5.0 | An excellent, practical, and well-structured report request that is highly relevant to 5G core network operations. |
| 21 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 7hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | The terms are correct and relevant. 5G-AKA is the primary 5G authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a valid encryption algorithm as per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent combines multiple, distinct security event triggers into a single notification rule with a specified priority. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly confusing. It's unclear if the key rotation is a separate notification event or is somehow linked to the failures/breaches. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly defines the intent as a Regular Notification Request. | 3 | The coherence is weakened by the ambiguous relationship between the different event triggers mentioned in the same sentence. | 4 | The elements are all related to security, but their combination without clearer logic could lead to inconsistent alert handling. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers and priority but could be more complete by defining the notification delivery method. | 4.0 | A technically correct notification intent that uses valid 3GPP terms but suffers from ambiguous phrasing, reducing its clarity. |
| 22 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 9GB DDR4 memory and 9016GB SATA_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | The request to evaluate resource requirements is a standard part of NFV planning. The hardware types are valid, although the ratio of memory to storage is unusual. | 3 | This is a relatively simple feasibility check focused on two hardware parameters and a generic performance analysis. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a perfect fit for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the specific values (9GB RAM vs 9TB storage) seem somewhat imbalanced for a typical NF. | 4 | The components are consistent in principle, but the numerical values might be inconsistent with a real-world server configuration. | 3 | The intent lacks context about the workload or NF, which is essential for any meaningful performance analysis. | 4.0 | A straightforward feasibility check that is easy to understand but lacks context and uses a slightly questionable resource ratio. |
| 23 | Intent Report Request | Evaluate service availability metrics reporting 99.99% availability achievement and 99.9% reliability performance with trend analysis and predictive insights. [Instance-3023-9383] | 5 | This aligns with 3GPP management functions for performance monitoring and reporting (e.g., TS 28.552). Availability and reliability are key performance indicators (KPIs). | 5 | The request is complex, asking for specific metrics, a comparison against targets, trend analysis, and predictive insights, which requires advanced analytical capabilities. | 5 | The description is very clear, well-structured, and uses standard industry terminology. | 5 | Although it starts with "Evaluate", the core request is to report metrics and analysis, fitting the Intent Report Request type. | 5 | The intent flows logically from raw metrics to advanced analytics (trends, predictions). | 5 | The concepts of availability, reliability, trend analysis, and predictive insights are all consistent and complementary. | 5 | This is a complete and well-defined request, specifying the KPIs and the depth of analysis required. | 5.0 | An excellent example of a high-level, analytics-driven report request that is directly relevant to service assurance. |
| 24 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with 2 x86_64 cores and 17GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 4 | The intent to provision compute resources is a fundamental concept in NFV MANO. The specified hardware (x86_64, DDR4) is standard. | 3 | It specifies a basic set of compute resources (cores, memory), representing a low-to-moderate level of complexity. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly and concisely. | 5 | "Provision... resources" is a clear expression of a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The structure is logical and straightforward. | 5 | The resources described are consistent with provisioning a virtual machine or container for a network function. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it does not specify which "demanding network functions" are to be deployed on these resources. | 4.3 | A clear, simple deployment intent for resource provisioning, which would be significantly improved by naming the target NF. |
| 25 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 82 core utilization and 352GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This request is perfectly aligned with the operational requirements for managing a 5G AMF and the analytical capabilities envisioned for functions like NWDAF. | 5 | The request is complex, requiring not just data collection but also pattern analysis and the generation of actionable optimization recommendations. | 5 | The language is precise, professional, and clearly outlines all aspects of the desired report. | 5 | "Generate... report" is a direct match for the Intent Report Request type. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, logically progressing from data metrics to insightful recommendations. | 5 | All components of the request are consistent and contribute to a unified and valuable analytics outcome. | 5 | This is a very complete request, specifying the NF (AMF), the context (deterministic performance), the metrics, and the desired output. | 5.0 | Another excellent and highly practical report request, demonstrating a sophisticated approach to network performance management. |
| 26 | Deployment Intent | "Guarantee 1213Mbps maximum bitrate delivery with mission-critical 7.78e-07 packet error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic shaping and congestion control algorithms." | 5 | This aligns with 3GPP QoS framework (TS 23.501) where parameters like Maximum Bitrate and Packet Error Rate are defined to guarantee service quality. Traffic shaping is a standard mechanism to enforce this. | 5 | The intent is complex, defining a service with very specific and stringent performance targets (bitrate, PER) and specifying the methods to achieve them (traffic shaping). | 5 | The description is technically dense but very clear for a network engineer or an automation system. | 5 | "Guarantee... delivery" and "implementing..." are clear deployment actions for a service policy. | 5 | The intent coherently links the desired QoS outcome with the technical mechanisms required to enforce it. | 5 | The specified bitrate, low packet error rate, and traffic shaping mechanisms are all consistent with a high-quality, mission-critical service. | 5 | This is a complete intent for deploying a QoS policy, specifying the key performance indicators and enforcement methods. | 5.0 | An outstanding deployment intent that precisely defines a high-level service requirement using correct, standards-aligned terminology. |
| 27 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 79 core utilization and 90GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This is a realistic and relevant request for managing the performance and resource efficiency of a 5G AMF, aligning with 3GPP management principles. | 5 | The request is complex, asking for data analysis (patterns) and prescriptive advice (recommendations) rather than just a simple data dump. | 5 | The intent is clearly and professionally worded, making the requirements unambiguous. | 5 | "Generate... report" clearly identifies this as an Intent Report Request. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, moving from data collection to analysis to actionable output. | 5 | The components are all consistent with a comprehensive performance review. | 5 | The request is complete, specifying the target NF (AMF), the metrics, the priority, and the nature of the desired output. | 5.0 | A high-quality, practical, and well-defined report request that is directly applicable to 5G network operations. |

The ML model name is synthetic but plausible. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying a particular type of ML model, a precise accuracy target, and the goal of autonomous optimization. | 4 | The language is technical and clear to a data scientist or ML engineer, though the model name is long. | 5 | "Implement autonomous performance optimization" is a core statement of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the tool (ML model) and its required performance (accuracy) to the high-level goal. | 5 | A model with high prediction accuracy is a consistent prerequisite for effective autonomous network management. | 5 | This is a very complete intent, specifying the method, its target performance, and its ultimate purpose. | 4.7 | A sophisticated and forward-looking intent that accurately captures the use of ML for proactive performance assurance. |
| 29 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 22hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | The terms are correct. EAP-AKA' (EAP-AKA Prime) is a valid authentication protocol (RFC 5448). 128-NEA3 (ZUC) is a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent defines a notification rule with multiple triggers related to advanced security protocols. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly ambiguous, making the relationship between the failure/breach alerts and the key rotation notification unclear. | 5 | "Alert on..." is a clear indicator of a Regular Notification Request. | 3 | The coherence is reduced by the awkward phrasing that combines potentially separate alert conditions. | 4 | All components relate to security, but their combination in one sentence could be interpreted in different, potentially inconsistent ways. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers and priority, but not the delivery mechanism. | 4.0 | A technically correct notification intent using valid security terms, but its clarity is hampered by ambiguous sentence structure. |

| 63 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 53 core utilization and 206GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | A highly realistic and valuable request for managing the performance and resource efficiency of a 5G AMF. | 5 | The complexity is high as it demands pattern analysis and prescriptive, high-priority recommendations. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and well-structured. | 5 | "Generate... report" clearly defines the intent type. | 5 | The request is very coherent, building from metrics to analysis to recommendations. | 5 | All elements are consistent and contribute to a single, well-defined analytical task. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the target, the metrics, and the expected outcome. | 5.0 | An excellent and well-formed report request, perfectly suited for modern, analytics-driven network operations. |
| 64 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 96 processing cores and 225GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Resource modification is a standard concept. However, linking compute resource allocation directly to "transport network optimization" is a bit vague. Usually, compute affects NF processing, which in turn affects the traffic sent *over* the transport network. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, linking compute resource changes to a broader network domain (transport network). | 3 | The phrasing "Modify core network 96 processing cores" is slightly awkward. The connection between compute resources and "transport network optimization" is not clearly explained. | 5 | "Modify..." clearly indicates a Modification Intent. | 3 | The coherence is weak. It's unclear how changing CPU cores and memory for an unspecified NF directly optimizes the transport network itself. | 3 | There's a potential inconsistency in cause and effect; compute resource changes for NFs are not the primary way to optimize a transport network (which usually involves routing, traffic engineering, etc.). | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify which core network function's resources are being modified. | 3.6 | A somewhat confusing modification intent with a vague and potentially incoherent link between the action and the stated goal. |
| 65 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 112 core utilization and 81GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This is a standard and practical request for managing a 5G AMF, reflecting common operational needs for performance and efficiency. | 5 | The request is complex, as it requires analysis and prescriptive recommendations, not just data reporting. | 5 | The description is clear, professional, and unambiguous. | 5 | "Generate... report" is a direct match for an Intent Report Request. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, moving from data to insights to actions. | 5 | All components of the request are consistent and support the overall goal. | 5 | The request is complete, specifying the target NF, metrics, and desired output. | 5.0 | A high-quality, realistic, and well-structured report request, perfect for an automated network analytics platform. |

It correctly identifies a valid authentication (EAP-AKA') and encryption (128-NEA1) combination and links it to performance under high density. | 5 | The intent is complex, requiring an analysis that correlates a massive network load (device density) with the computational overhead of specific security protocols. | 5 | The description is clear and technically precise. | 5 | "Consider... impact on system performance" is a clear feasibility check. | 5 | It coherently links network conditions (density) with security protocols and their systemic impact. | 5 | All components are consistent and relevant for assessing performance in a high-density IoT scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the conditions to be tested and the criteria for evaluation. | 5.0 | An excellent, realistic, and standards-aligned feasibility check that is directly relevant to 5G mMTC scenarios. |
| 68 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 36 processing cores and 273GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | Aligns with standard resource modification capabilities in virtualized environments (ETSI NFV). The parameters are plausible for managing a network function. | 4 | The intent is detailed, specifying multiple resource parameters and linking them to the dual objectives of performance and cost. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and easily parsible for automation. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The structure is logical, following a command-parameter-goal format. | 5 | The specified adjustments are consistent with the goal of performance and cost optimization. | 4 | The intent is complete in what it asks for but would be more actionable if it specified the target NF. | 4.6 | A clear and well-formed modification intent, providing specific, actionable parameters for resource orchestration. |
| 69 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with 3 x86_64 cores and 10GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 4 | The intent to provision compute resources is fundamental to NFV MANO. The hardware specs (x86_64, DDR5) are contemporary. | 3 | It specifies a basic set of compute resources, representing a low-to-moderate level of complexity. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly and concisely. | 5 | "Provision... resources" is a clear expression of a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The structure is logical and straightforward. | 5 | The resources described are consistent with provisioning a VM or container for a network function. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it does not specify which "demanding network functions" are to be deployed on these resources. | 4.3 | A clear, simple deployment intent for resource provisioning, which would be significantly improved by naming the target NF. |
| 70 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 62 RISC_V processing cores at 3.6GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid and relevant feasibility check. Evaluating a key 5G NF (AMF) on an emerging architecture like RISC-V is a plausible task for future network planning or research. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, naming the NF, priority, architecture, core count, and clock speed. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, specifying the subject, the platform, and the criteria for assessment. | 5 | The components are consistent for a hardware platform evaluation task. | 5 | This is a complete and well-defined feasibility request. | 4.9 | An excellent and forward-looking feasibility check that correctly specifies a key 5G NF and a relevant emerging processor architecture. |
| 71 | Deployment Intent | "Secure multi-domain orchestration using HMAC_SHA384 key derivation functions with 128_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 10hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle." | 4 | The security concepts are valid (HMAC-SHA384, key rotation), but their application to "multi-domain orchestration" is generic. 3GPP specifies security for specific interfaces, but this is a high-level policy. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying cryptographic algorithms, key lengths, and rotation policies for a broad domain. | 5 | The description is clear and easy to understand for a security architect. | 5 | "Secure multi-domain orchestration using..." is a deployment of a security policy, so it fits Deployment Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently links the security mechanisms to the goal of maintaining security posture. | 5 | The use of strong hashing, defined key sizes, and automated rotation are consistent elements of a robust security policy. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete for a security policy but could be more specific about which interfaces or domains are being secured. | 4.6 | A good, high-level intent for deploying a security policy for orchestration, using valid cryptographic concepts. |
| 72 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 8hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | The technical terms are correct (EAP-TLS, 128-NEA1). The request for alerts on security events is standard. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security event triggers into one notification rule. | 3 | The phrasing is ambiguous. It's not clear if the key rotation is a third, separate event to be notified about, or if it is related to the other two. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly marks this as a Regular Notification Request. | 3 | The coherence is weak due to the unclear relationship between the failure/breach alerts and the key rotation notification. | 4 | The elements are all security-related, but their combination without clearer logic could be interpreted inconsistently. | 4 | It specifies the triggers but lacks detail on the notification channel or recipients. | 3.9 | A valid notification intent using correct technical terms but suffering from ambiguous sentence structure that hurts its clarity. |
| 73 | Performance Assurance Intent | Achieve autonomous performance management with minimal human intervention and intelligent self-optimization. [Instance-3073-9621] | 4 | This is a high-level, aspirational intent that perfectly captures the goals of frameworks like 3GPP ZSM (Zero-touch network and Service Management) and ETSI ZSM. | 3 | The intent is very high-level and abstract, lacking specific technical details or metrics. | 5 | The language is clear and effectively communicates the strategic goal. | 5 | "Achieve autonomous performance management" is a quintessential Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, stating a clear and logical objective for network operations. | 5 | All phrases in the intent are consistent with the goal of full automation. | 2 | The intent is very incomplete. It states a goal but provides no specifics on what performance to manage, what metrics to use, or what systems are involved. | 4.1 | A great example of a high-level strategic intent, though it lacks the specific details needed for direct implementation. |
| 74 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 29 x86_64 processing cores at 2.61GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | This is a very practical and realistic feasibility check, essential for planning the deployment of a 5G AMF on standard COTS hardware. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, including the NF (AMF), priority, core count, architecture, clock speed, and performance criteria. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous. | 5 | "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The intent is well-structured, specifying the target, the platform, and the evaluation criteria. | 5 | The components are consistent for a hardware performance and feasibility analysis. | 5 | This is a complete and well-defined feasibility request. | 4.9 | An excellent, industry-relevant feasibility check that is directly applicable to 5G network deployment planning. |
| 75 | Intent Report Request | "Analyze network high-throughput performance comparing 1000Mbps target high-throughput against 5ms latency requirements, providing insights into performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. [Instance-3075-9639]" | 5 | This aligns with performance monitoring functions specified in 3GPP TS 28.552. Analyzing throughput vs. latency is a fundamental task for services like eMBB or URLLC. | 5 | The request is complex, asking for a comparative analysis against targets, bottleneck identification, and optimization suggestions, which requires advanced analytics. | 5 | The description is very clear and precisely defines the scope and purpose of the analysis. | 5 | "Analyze... providing insights" clearly fits the purpose of an Intent Report Request. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, progressing from comparison to bottleneck analysis to optimization opportunities. | 5 | The relationship between throughput and latency is a critical and consistent one in network performance analysis. | 5 | This is a very complete request, specifying the KPIs, targets, and the type of analytical insights required. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-defined report request that targets a critical performance trade-off and asks for actionable insights. |
| 76 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | The terms are correct and relevant. 5G-AKA is the primary 5G authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a valid encryption algorithm as per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent combines multiple, distinct security event triggers into a single notification rule with a specified priority. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly confusing. It's unclear if the key rotation is a separate notification event or is somehow linked to the failures/breaches. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly defines the intent as a Regular Notification Request. | 3 | The coherence is weakened by the ambiguous relationship between the different event triggers mentioned in the same sentence. | 4 | The elements are all related to security, but their combination without clearer logic could lead to inconsistent alert handling. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers and priority but could be more complete by defining the notification delivery method. | 4.0 | A technically correct notification intent that uses valid 3GPP terms but suffers from ambiguous phrasing, reducing its clarity. |
| 77 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 399GB DDR5 memory and 7278GB Optane storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is a valid feasibility check for high-performance infrastructure. Optane is a real technology (though now discontinued for client, still relevant in servers), known for low latency, making it relevant for "deterministic performance." | 4 | The intent specifies modern, high-end hardware (DDR5, Optane) and links it to a complex performance requirement. | 5 | The description is clearly written and easy to understand. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a perfect fit for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The structure is logical: evaluate [hardware] with [analysis type]. | 5 | The specified high-performance hardware is consistent with the need for a deterministic performance analysis. | 3 | The intent lacks the context of the NF or service being evaluated, which is a key missing piece for a meaningful analysis. | 4.4 | A strong feasibility check for high-performance infrastructure, though it would be more actionable with a specified workload. |
| 78 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 209GB LPDDR5 memory and 1321GB Optane storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is an interesting but plausible check. LPDDR5 is typically for mobile/edge devices, while Optane is for servers. This could be a check for a high-performance edge computing node. | 4 | The mix of mobile-centric memory (LPDDR5) with server-grade storage (Optane) makes the evaluation contextually complex. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a clear match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the combination of hardware components is slightly unusual, suggesting a specific edge use case. | 4 | The components are technically consistent, but their pairing is not typical for a standard core network server. | 3 | The intent is clear but lacks the critical context of the target device or function, which is especially important given the unusual hardware mix. | 4.1 | An interesting feasibility check that hints at an edge computing scenario, but it crucially lacks the context to be fully evaluated. |
| 79 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 512ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This reflects the industry trend towards automated, closed-loop performance management, which is supported by evolving 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent specifies a precise performance target and the complex, automated systems required to maintain it. | 5 | The intent is expressed clearly and concisely. | 5 | "Optimize performance" directly corresponds to the Performance Assurance Intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links a performance goal with the methods to achieve it. | 5 | The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation is a consistent strategy for meeting a defined response time SLA. | 4 | The intent is good, but lacks the context of which service or application is being targeted for optimization. | 4.6 | A well-formed and relevant performance assurance intent, clearly stating the performance goal and the means to achieve it. |
| 80 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-3080-9666] | 5 | This is a perfect example of an SLO/SLA monitoring alert, fully aligned with 3GPP performance management standards (e.g., TS 28.552). Throughput and latency are key KPIs. | 4 | The intent defines a notification with two distinct performance triggers (throughput and latency) and specifies an automated response (escalation). | 5 | The description is very clear, precise, and easily translatable into a monitoring rule. | 5 | "Alert when..." is a classic Regular Notification Request. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, clearly stating the conditions for the alert. | 5 | Monitoring for drops in throughput and increases in latency are consistent and complementary actions for performance assurance. | 5 | This is a complete notification intent, specifying the triggers and the initial action (escalation). | 4.9 | An excellent, practical, and well-defined notification intent for performance monitoring, directly applicable to service assurance. |
| 81 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 600ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This intent aligns with modern closed-loop automation principles for network management, setting a performance target and specifying the automated methods to maintain it. | 4 | It combines a specific, quantifiable performance goal with complex, high-level methodologies like predictive analytics and auto-remediation. | 5 | The intent is clearly and concisely worded, making it easy to understand. | 5 | "Optimize... performance achieving..." is a classic example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome (a specific response time) with the proactive methods to ensure it. | 5 | The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation is fully consistent with achieving a stringent performance target. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be improved by specifying the service or application for which this response time is targeted. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant performance assurance intent that effectively describes a modern, automated approach to SLO management. |
| 82 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 97 processing cores and 131GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | This is consistent with the principles of dynamic resource allocation in virtualized network environments (ETSI NFV). The specified parameters are plausible. | 4 | It specifies multiple precise resource parameters and connects them to the dual objectives of performance and cost, giving it a good level of detail. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and easily parsible, making it ideal for automation. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" clearly identifies this as a Modification Intent. | 5 | The structure is logical and follows a command-parameter-goal format. | 5 | The specified adjustments are consistent with the goal of performance and cost optimization. | 4 | The intent is complete in what it asks for, but would be more useful if it specified the target NF. | 4.6 | A standard and well-formed modification intent, providing clear, actionable parameters for resource orchestration. |
| 83 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 8hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | All technical terms are correct. 5G-AKA is the primary 5G authentication method, and 128-NEA3 (ZUC) is a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security event triggers into a single notification rule. | 3 | The phrasing is ambiguous. The relationship between the failure/breach alerts and the key rotation notification is unclear. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly identifies this as a Regular Notification Request. | 3 | The coherence is hampered by the awkward sentence structure that mixes different alert conditions. | 4 | All elements are related to security, but their unclear linkage could be interpreted inconsistently. | 4 | The intent specifies triggers but lacks a defined notification channel. | 4.0 | A technically correct notification intent that uses valid security terms but is hindered by ambiguous phrasing that reduces its clarity. |
| 84 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy intelligent edge massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems infrastructure with DISTRIBUTED deployment strategy supporting 133318_devices_per_km2 device massive connectivity high-density, enabling ultra-low latency applications and local data processing." | 5 | This intent perfectly captures the essence of deploying a network for the 5G mMTC (massive Machine-Type Communications) use case, combined with edge computing. All concepts are aligned with 3GPP's vision for 5G evolution. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, describing a complete ecosystem deployment including use case (mMTC), architecture (edge), strategy (distributed), and specific performance metrics (device density). | 5 | The description is clear and provides a comprehensive picture of the desired deployment. | 5 | "Deploy... infrastructure" is a clear Deployment Intent. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, with all components logically supporting the goal of a distributed, high-density IoT network. | 5 | All concepts—edge computing, mMTC, high device density, and low latency—are consistent and synergistic. | 5 | This is a very complete intent, defining the what, how, and why of the deployment. | 5.0 | An outstanding, comprehensive intent that accurately describes a modern, complex 5G deployment for IoT and edge computing. |
| 85 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-3085-9692] | 4 | The performance targets (1Gbps, 5ms) are characteristic of 5G eMBB or URLLC services. The idea of using "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" aligns with the principles of automated resource management in NFV. | 4 | The intent combines specific, high-performance network KPIs with a method for achieving them (CPU-based scaling), making it moderately complex. | 4 | The phrase "high-throughput high-capacity" is slightly redundant but the overall intent is clear. | 5 | "Implement... achieving..." is a clear statement of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently links the performance goals with the scaling mechanism intended to deliver them. | 4 | It's slightly inconsistent to imply that CPU-based scaling alone can guarantee both throughput and latency, as other factors (e.g., transport network, radio conditions) are critical. | 4 | The intent specifies the goals and a mechanism, but could be more complete by defining the scope (e.g., for which service or slice). | 4.3 | A good performance assurance intent that sets clear goals, though it oversimplifies the method for achieving them. |
| 86 | Deployment Intent | "Execute mission-critical massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems deployment with mission-critical Standalone_5G network architecture and Massive_MIMO_32T32R MIMO antenna systems, ensuring ultra-reliable massive connectivity for critical applications." | 5 | This is a highly relevant and standards-aligned intent.

The specific times are unusual but clearly stated. | 4 | While it starts with "Monitor," the core action is to deploy a monitoring system with specific rules, making it a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently links the detection method with the response procedure (escalation). | 4 | The escalation timeline (5m, 6m, 54m) is strangely spaced, which seems slightly inconsistent from a practical standpoint, but is not a technical contradiction. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the detection method, the response policy, and the overall goal. | 4.6 | A clear and practical intent for deploying a security monitoring and response capability, with a somewhat peculiar escalation timeline. |
| 88 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 442GB DDR5 memory and 799GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is a valid feasibility check. However, pairing a large amount of very fast memory (DDR5) with slower, lower-capacity storage (SATA SSD) is an unusual configuration for a high-performance server. | 3 | The request is a straightforward evaluation of two hardware components. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a perfect fit for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the hardware combination is somewhat imbalanced. | 3 | There's a potential performance inconsistency. A system needing 442GB of DDR5 is likely I/O-bound by a single 799GB SATA SSD, making the combination questionable. | 3 | The intent lacks context on the target NF or workload, which is crucial for understanding the rationale behind the unusual hardware mix. | 3.9 | A clear feasibility check that is weakened by a questionable and imbalanced hardware configuration and a lack of context. |

| 131 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with 5hours automated key management. | 2 | This is incorrect. 3GPP's NEA1 (AES) is specified with a 128-bit key in TS 33.501. "256_NEA1" is a standards violation. 5G-AKA is correct. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security functions (authentication, encryption, key management) into a single policy. | 5 | The description is clearly written and easy to parse. | 5 | "Secure performance assurance" clearly states the intent's purpose. | 5 | The intent logically groups together the core components of a security policy. | 2 | The use of "256_NEA1" is inconsistent with 3GPP standards, which define NEA1 with a 128-bit key. | 5 | It's a complete definition of a security policy, despite the technical error. | 4.0 | A well-structured intent that is undermined by a significant technical inaccuracy regarding the key length of the NEA1 encryption algorithm. |
| 132 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 2minutes/15minutes/53minutes multi-tier escalation through gRPC notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 5 | This is a highly relevant and detailed operational intent. It specifies not just an escalation policy but also the transport mechanism (gRPC), which is increasingly used in modern systems, and an advanced feature (intelligent routing).

| 133 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 70 processing cores and 414GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Resource modification is a standard concept. However, the linkage between compute resources and "transport network optimization" is vague and indirect. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, linking compute resource changes to a broader, separate network domain (transport). | 3 | The phrasing is awkward ("Modify core network 70 processing cores...") and the causal link between compute resources and transport optimization is unclear. | 5 | "Modify..." clearly identifies this as a Modification Intent. | 3 | The coherence is weak. It's unclear how changing CPU/memory for an NF directly optimizes the transport network itself. | 3 | There's a potential inconsistency, as transport network optimization typically involves routing, not NF compute scaling. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify which core network function's resources are being modified. | 3.6 | A somewhat confusing modification intent with a vague and potentially incoherent link between the action and the stated goal. |

| 136 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics.

| 139 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication and 128_NEA3 encryption with mission-critical 1hours automated key management. | 5 | All components are correct and aligned with 3GPP standards. 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method in 5G, and 128-NEA3 (ZUC) is a standard cipher (TS 33.501). | 4 | It combines three critical security aspects: authentication (5G-AKA), encryption (128-NEA3), and key management, along with fault-tolerance and priority. | 5 | The intent is clearly articulated, with all technical terms used correctly and in a logical sequence. | 5 | This is a clear Performance Assurance Intent with a focus on securing the network. | 5 | The intent coherently bundles authentication, encryption, and key management into a single security policy. | 5 | All elements are consistent with creating a secure and resilient 5G communication environment. | 5 | This is a complete intent that specifies the what (security mechanisms) and how (fault-tolerant, automated key management). | 4.9 | An excellent, technically accurate, and comprehensive intent for establishing a secure performance assurance policy in a 5G network. |

| 150 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 118GB LPDDR5 memory and 7193GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is an unusual but plausible check, possibly for an edge data center or custom hardware. LPDDR5 (low-power) is less common in servers, and pairing it with a large SATA SSD is an interesting choice. | 4 | The mix of mobile-centric memory (LPDDR5) with a large amount of traditional storage makes the evaluation contextually complex. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a clear match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the combination of hardware components is unusual. | 3 | The components are technically consistent, but their pairing seems imbalanced for most typical workloads. Low-power RAM with high-capacity, slower storage is a niche combination. | 3 | The intent is clear but lacks the critical context of the target device or function, which is especially important given the unusual hardware mix. | 4.0 | An interesting feasibility check that suggests a specialized use case, but it lacks the context needed for a full evaluation and the hardware mix is questionable. |
| 151 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 455GB LPDDR5 memory and 2295GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | Similar to the previous one, this is an unusual but plausible check for custom hardware, perhaps an edge server. The LPDDR5/SATA SSD combination is not standard for high-performance core NFs. | 4 | The mix of low-power memory with a large amount of traditional storage makes the evaluation contextually complex. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a clear match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the combination of hardware components is unusual. | 3 | The pairing seems imbalanced. A workload requiring 455GB of RAM would likely be bottlenecked by SATA SSDs, making NVMe storage a more consistent choice. | 3 | The intent lacks the critical context of the target device or function, which is especially important given the unusual hardware mix. | 4.0 | An interesting feasibility check suggesting a specialized use case, but it lacks context and the hardware combination is performance-inconsistent. |
| 152 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 82 x86_64 processing cores at 1.59GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a very practical and realistic feasibility check.

| 154 | Modification Intent | "Adjust network high-capacity to 6076Mbps broadband allocation and 856802_devices_per_km2 connection density requirements, accommodating growing user demands and traffic patterns." | 5 | This is a high-level service or slice modification intent. It aligns with the need to dynamically adjust network slice parameters (e.g., for eMBB and mMTC) to meet changing demand, a key concept in 5G management. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying changes to two different network-wide parameters (throughput and device density). | 4 | The term "network high-capacity" is a bit vague, but the context makes the meaning clear. The rest is very readable. | 5 | "Adjust..." to meet new requirements is a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently links the modification of network parameters to the business driver (growing user demands). | 5 | Increasing both broadband capacity and connection density are consistent actions for upgrading a network to handle more traffic and users. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete but lacks specifics on *how* this adjustment should be implemented (e.g., by reallocating resources, changing slice parameters). | 4.6 | A good example of a high-level, service-oriented modification intent, reflecting business needs rather than specific resource changes. |
| 155 | Modification Intent | Adjust Massive_MIMO_64T64R radio parameters and Vertical_Beamforming beamforming configuration with high-priority core network coordination. | 5 | The terms (Massive MIMO, Vertical Beamforming) are standard 5G RAN technologies. The need for coordination with the core network for certain radio changes is also a valid and important concept. | 5 | The intent is complex as it involves modifying advanced radio parameters and requires coordination across network domains (RAN and Core). | 5 | The description is technically dense but clear to a network engineer. | 5 | "Adjust... parameters and... configuration" is a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, correctly identifying that radio-level changes may require coordination with the core network. | 5 | Adjusting MIMO and beamforming parameters is a consistent set of actions for RAN optimization. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying what to modify and the necessary coordination constraint. | 5.0 | An excellent and technically sophisticated modification intent that correctly captures the cross-domain nature of advanced RAN optimizations. |
| 156 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 80GB HBM2 memory and 7506GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is a very unusual configuration. HBM2 is extremely high-performance memory, while SATA SSD is relatively slow. Pairing them is highly suspect from a performance standpoint, making it an interesting, if questionable, feasibility check. | 4 | The unusual hardware combination makes the analysis contextually complex. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a clear match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 3 | The structure is logical, but the hardware combination is so imbalanced it borders on incoherent. | 2 | There is a major performance inconsistency.

| 190 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 33ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.006975 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | This aligns perfectly with the 5G QoS framework (TS 23.501), where Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER) are standard QoS characteristics used to define a QoS Flow. | 5 | The intent is complex, setting two specific and stringent QoS targets and mentioning the advanced mechanisms needed to enforce them. | 5 | The description is technically precise and clearly communicates the desired service quality. | 5 | "Configure... implementing..." to assure a certain quality level is a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently links the desired QoS parameters with the enforcement mechanisms. | 5 | A defined delay budget and error rate are consistent and standard parameters for assuring quality of service. | 5 | The intent is complete for defining a QoS policy, specifying the key performance indicators and mentioning enforcement. | 5.0 | An excellent intent that accurately uses 3GPP QoS terminology to define a strict performance assurance policy. |
| 191 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 311GB LPDDR5 memory and 7800GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is an unusual but plausible check, possibly for a custom edge server that needs both low-power RAM and high-performance storage. LPDDR5 is less common in servers but feasible. | 4 | The mix of low-power memory with a large amount of high-performance storage makes the evaluation contextually complex. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a clear match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 4 | The structure is logical, and this hardware combination (low-power RAM, fast storage) is more balanced than previous LPDDR examples. | 4 | The components are technically consistent, and this pairing could be suitable for data-intensive edge AI or analytics workloads. | 3 | The intent lacks the critical context of the target device or function, which is especially important given the unusual hardware mix. | 4.1 | An interesting feasibility check for a plausible high-performance edge configuration, but it lacks workload context. |
| 192 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 473ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Aligns with the modern approach of closed-loop automation for maintaining SLAs, a concept central to 3GPP management frameworks like NWDAF. | 4 | It combines a specific performance target with complex, advanced methodologies for achieving it. | 5 | The intent is clearly and concisely worded. | 5 | "Optimize performance" is a clear statement of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | It logically connects the desired outcome (low response time) with the proactive methods used to maintain it. | 5 | Predictive analytics and automated remediation are consistent and appropriate tools for achieving a high-priority response time target. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the service to which the target applies. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant performance assurance intent that clearly defines a performance goal and the automated means to achieve it. |
| 193 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 112 core utilization and 340GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This is another standard and highly relevant request for managing the operational performance of a 5G AMF, particularly for services requiring deterministic guarantees (like URLLC). | 5 | The complexity is high as it demands analytical insights and actionable recommendations, not just raw data. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and well-structured. | 5 | "Generate... report" clearly defines the intent type. | 5 | The request is very coherent, building from metrics to analysis to recommendations. | 5 | All elements are consistent and contribute to a single, well-defined analytical task. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the target, the metrics, and the expected outcome. | 5.0 | A high-quality, practical, and well-formed report request, perfectly suited for modern network operations, with a good focus on deterministic performance. |
| 194 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 577ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This intent aligns with modern closed-loop automation principles for network management, setting a performance target and specifying the automated methods to maintain it. | 4 | It combines a specific, quantifiable performance goal with complex, high-level methodologies like predictive analytics and auto-remediation. | 5 | The intent is clearly and concisely worded, making it easy to understand. | 5 | "Optimize... performance achieving..." is a classic example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome (a specific response time) with the proactive methods to ensure it. | 5 | The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation is fully consistent with achieving a stringent performance target. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be improved by specifying the service or application for which this response time is targeted. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant performance assurance intent that effectively describes a modern, automated approach to SLO management. |
| 195 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 996ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This intent aligns with modern closed-loop automation principles for network management, setting a performance target and specifying the automated methods to maintain it. | 4 | It combines a specific, quantifiable performance goal with complex, high-level methodologies like predictive analytics and auto-remediation. | 5 | The intent is clearly and concisely worded, making it easy to understand. | 5 | "Optimize... performance achieving..." is a classic example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome (a specific response time) with the proactive methods to ensure it. | 5 | The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation is fully consistent with achieving a stringent performance target. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be improved by specifying the service or application for which this response time is targeted. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant performance assurance intent that effectively describes a modern, automated approach to SLO management. |
| 196 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-3196-311] | 4 | The performance targets (1Gbps, 5ms) are characteristic of 5G eMBB or URLLC services. The idea of using "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" aligns with the principles of automated resource management in NFV. | 4 | The intent combines specific, high-performance network KPIs with a method for achieving them (CPU-based scaling), making it moderately complex. | 4 | The phrase "high-throughput high-capacity" is slightly redundant but the overall intent is clear. | 5 | "Implement... achieving..." is a clear statement of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently links the performance goals with the scaling mechanism intended to deliver them. | 4 | It's slightly inconsistent to imply that CPU-based scaling alone can guarantee both throughput and latency, as other factors (e.g., transport network, radio conditions) are critical. | 4 | The intent specifies the goals and a mechanism, but could be more complete by defining the scope (e.g., for which service or slice). | 4.3 | A good performance assurance intent that sets clear goals, though it oversimplifies the method for achieving them. |
| 197 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using fault-tolerant EAP_TLS authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols with mission-criticalout compromising performance characteristics. | 2 | This is incorrect. 3GPP's NEA1 (AES) is specified with a 128-bit key in TS 33.501. "256_NEA1" is a standards violation. EAP-TLS is correct. Also contains a typo ("criticalout"). | 4 | The intent combines multiple security functions with non-functional performance requirements. | 4 | The description is mostly clear but contains a typo ("criticalout" for "critical without"). | 5 | "Secure high-performance infrastructure" clearly states the intent's purpose. | 5 | The intent logically groups together the security mechanisms and performance goals. | 2 | The use of "256_NEA1" is inconsistent with 3GPP standards, creating a major technical error. | 5 | It's a complete definition of a security policy, aside from the errors. | 3.9 | A well-structured intent that is critically flawed by a factual error in the encryption algorithm and a minor typo. |
| 198 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate AMF deployment through nfvo_9f0681374d2a Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_9be88ab7e135 VNF Manager integration. | 5 | This perfectly describes the standard ETSI NFV MANO process for deploying a Network Function (AMF) via the interaction of the NFVO and VNFM. | 5 | This intent describes a complex orchestration workflow involving two key management entities for a specific 5G NF. | 5 | The description is clear and accurately reflects the standardized NFV deployment model. | 5 | "Coordinate AMF deployment" is a clear Deployment Intent. | 5 | The intent is perfectly coherent, describing the correct roles and interactions of the NFVO and VNFM for AMF deployment. | 5 | The described workflow is fully consistent with the ETSI NFV MANO standards. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF to be deployed and the management entities responsible. | 5.0 | A perfect, textbook example of a deployment intent within a standardized NFV MANO framework. |
| 199 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 222ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This intent aligns with modern closed-loop automation principles for network management, setting a performance target and specifying the automated methods to maintain it. | 4 | It combines a specific, quantifiable performance goal with complex, high-level methodologies like predictive analytics and auto-remediation. | 5 | The intent is clearly and concisely worded, making it easy to understand. | 5 | "Optimize... performance achieving..." is a classic example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome (a specific response time) with the proactive methods to ensure it. | 5 | The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation is fully consistent with achieving a stringent performance target. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be improved by specifying the service or application for which this response time is targeted. | 4.6 | A strong and relevant performance assurance intent that effectively describes a modern, automated approach to SLO management. |
| 200 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 363GB HBM2 memory and 1376GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 4 | This is a valid feasibility check for a very high-performance computing scenario. HBM2 (High Bandwidth Memory) and NVMe PCIe4 are both high-end technologies, suitable for specialized, demanding network functions. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the specialized and high-end nature of the hardware components being evaluated. | 5 | The language is clear and direct. | 5 | "Evaluate... requirements" is a clear match for an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The structure is logical: evaluate [hardware] with [analysis]. | 5 | The use of high-performance memory (HBM2) and storage (NVMe PCIe4) is consistent with a demanding performance analysis. | 3 | The intent lacks context on the target NF or workload, which is a critical piece of information for a meaningful evaluation. | 4.4 | A good feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but its value is diminished by the absence of workload context. |
