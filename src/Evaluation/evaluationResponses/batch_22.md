| 121 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 224.39ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 3 | The intent has a significant contradiction. It describes a "low priority" service with a high delay budget (224ms is not strict), but claims it supports "mission-critical applications" which typically require high priority and low latency. Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and PDB are standard concepts. | 4 | Defining and deploying a service with specific GBR and PDB QoS parameters is a complex task involving policy and resource management. | 4 | The intent is clearly written, but the contradictory terms reduce its overall clarity of purpose. | 5 | The action "Launch... network service" is a clear `Deployment Intent`. | 3 | The coherence is low due to the contradiction between "low priority" / high latency and "mission-critical" / "deterministic" claims. | 2 | The intent is internally inconsistent, mixing terms that describe opposite service characteristics (low priority vs. mission-critical). | 5 | It provides all the necessary technical parameters (priority, bitrate, delay budget) for a service definition, despite their contradictory nature. | 3.7 | The intent is technically well-formed but critically flawed by an internal contradiction in its business logic. |
