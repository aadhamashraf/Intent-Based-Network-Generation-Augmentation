| 1 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 125 processing cores and 179GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | The parameters (cores, memory, timeout) align with standard resource management concepts in ETSI ZSM and 3GPP management frameworks for virtualized network functions. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple resource dimensions (cores, memory), a specific constraint (timeout), and high-level goals (performance, cost), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and uses clear, unambiguous terms that are easily machine-parsable. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and precise match for a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The request to adjust resources, the constraints, and the optimization goals are all logically linked. | 5 | The parameters are internally consistent; a mission-critical timeout of 30 minutes (1800s) is plausible for certain long-running, non-real-time operational tasks. | 4 | The intent is highly specific about the resources but lacks the target entity (e.g., a specific network function or slice) to be fully actionable. | 4.7 | A clear and actionable intent for resource modification, slightly missing the target context for full completeness. |
| 2 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 128_NEA3 encryption with 6hours automated key management. | 5 | EAP-AKA' (Prime) is a valid 5G authentication method per 3GPP TS 33.501. 128-NEA3 refers to 128-bit ZUC encryption, a standard 5G algorithm. Key management is a fundamental security practice. | 4 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters: authentication method, encryption algorithm, and key rotation policy, giving it good technical depth. | 5 | The language is precise, using standard acronyms (EAP-AKA', NEA3) that are well-understood in the domain. | 5 | Securing the network is a fundamental aspect of assuring its performance and reliability, making this highly relevant. | 5 | The components (authentication, encryption, key management) form a complete and logical security policy statement. | 5 | All specified security mechanisms are compatible and work together to create a robust security posture. A 6-hour key rotation is a reasonable policy. | 4 | The intent defines the security mechanisms well but does not specify the scope (e.g., which interfaces or services this policy applies to). | 4.7 | A well-formed and technically correct intent that clearly defines a security policy for performance assurance. |
| 3 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with high-priority automated escalation. [Instance-3203-351] | 5 | The use of throughput and latency as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for notifications aligns perfectly with 3GPP and ETSI ZSM performance monitoring concepts. | 3 | The intent defines a common monitoring pattern with two conditions and a resulting action, which is standard but not overly complex. | 5 | The trigger conditions ("drops below," "exceeds") and the requested action are stated clearly and unambiguously. | 5 | This is a classic example of a "Regular Notification Request," asking for an alert based on specific performance events. | 5 | The structure is logical: a set of conditions (performance degradation) triggers a specific action (alert and escalate). | 5 | The performance targets (1Gbps throughput, 5ms latency) are consistent with high-performance services like eMBB or URLLC. | 4 | The intent is clear, but using the word "thresholds" without specifying the exact values makes it slightly less complete for immediate automation. | 4.6 | A very clear, practical, and well-formed intent for performance monitoring and alerting. |
| 4 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 20 core utilization and 170GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting performance analytics on a specific Network Function (AMF) using standard metrics (core/memory utilization) is fully aligned with 3GPP management functions (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | Specifies the target NF (AMF), the metrics for analysis, the desired output (report with recommendations), and a priority level. | 5 | The request is well-phrased, with a clear objective and defined parameters, making it easy to interpret. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Generate [a] report," which is a perfect match for the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | All parts of the request—the target, the analysis subject, and the expected output—are logically connected. | 5 | Analyzing resource consumption to provide optimization recommendations is a consistent and logical workflow in network management. | 5 | The request is sufficiently detailed to be actionable by an analytics system, specifying the target, metrics, and desired output. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for generating a specific performance report. |
| 5 | Deployment Intent | Deploy enterprise-grade PCF network function using Nokia SW_2.1.952 software on high-performance 3-core ARM64 architecture with 11GB DDR5 memory and 529GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability. | 5 | PCF is a standard 5G Core NF. Specifying software version, hardware architecture (ARM64), memory (DDR5), and storage (NVMe) are all standard parameters in NFV deployments. | 5 | This is a highly detailed intent specifying the NF type, vendor, software version, hardware architecture, and specific resource allocations. | 5 | The intent is structured as a clear, imperative command with all necessary parameters, making it ideal for automation. | 5 | The description to "Deploy" a specific network function is a textbook example of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | All the specified parameters logically contribute to a single, coherent instruction for deploying a network function. | 5 | The specified resources (3-core ARM64, 11GB DDR5) are consistent and plausible for a modern, efficient network function instance. | 5 | This intent provides a rich set of details, making it very complete and directly actionable by an orchestrator. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a detailed, actionable, and standards-aligned deployment intent. |
| 6 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication and 128-NEA2 (128-bit AES encryption) are valid concepts. However, the phrasing "key rotation event notifications" is slightly ambiguous; it's unclear if it's notifying *about* rotation events or if key rotation is a separate action. | 3 | The intent specifies triggers (auth failure, breach) and a notification about key rotation, but the relationship is slightly jumbled. | 3 | The sentence structure is slightly confusing. It seems to mix alert conditions with a separate notification topic ("key rotation event"). | 5 | The core request is to be alerted about security events, which aligns well with a "Regular Notification Request". | 3 | The coherence is weak because it conflates two distinct types of notifications: reactive alerts (failures, breaches) and proactive/informational alerts (key rotation). | 4 | The components are all related to security, so they are thematically consistent, even if the sentence structure is imperfect. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the connection between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is not clearly defined. | 3.6 | A decent notification intent that is slightly hampered by ambiguous phrasing and a lack of coherence between its clauses. |
| 7 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 175GB DDR4 memory and 6154GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | This aligns with the concept of feasibility checks in orchestration systems before committing resources. Memory (DDR4) and storage (NVMe_SSD) are standard hardware specifications. | 3 | The intent is straightforward, asking to evaluate two specific resource parameters and their performance impact. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" directly maps to the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to evaluate resource requirements and then analyze the performance impact is a logical sequence. | 5 | The parameters are consistent; it's a valid request to check the feasibility of allocating a large amount of memory and storage. | 4 | It's a well-defined check, but it would be more complete if it specified the context, such as the network function or service being deployed. | 4.6 | A clear and practical feasibility check, useful for resource planning before a deployment. |
| 8 | Modification Intent | Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with high-priority 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 8Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance. | 5 | All terms—Traditional MIMO 4T4R, 3D Beamforming, backhaul capacity—are standard concepts in 3GPP RAN specifications. This is a typical RAN optimization task. | 5 | This intent is complex, involving the reconfiguration of a specific antenna system (4T4R MIMO), applying an advanced technology (3D Beamforming), and enhancing backhaul. | 5 | The request is technically dense but clearly structured and highly readable for a radio access network engineer or automation system. | 5 | The verb "Reconfigure" clearly indicates this is a "Modification Intent" aimed at an existing system. | 5 | The components (antenna system, beamforming, backhaul) are all interrelated aspects of RAN performance and form a coherent optimization strategy. | 5 | Optimizing beamforming and increasing backhaul capacity are consistent and complementary actions to improve coverage and performance. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying what to change (MIMO system), how to change it (3D Beamforming), and an additional related change (backhaul). | 5.0 | An excellent, technically rich, and standards-aligned intent for RAN optimization. |
| 9 | Deployment Intent | Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 24Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 19.16ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics. | 4 | The use of Guaranteed Bitrate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) is correct per 3GPP TS 23.501. The values are specific and plausible. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple QoS parameters (priority, GBR, PDB) and the target application type. | 5 | The description is clearly written and easy to parse, with specific numerical values. | 5 | "Launch network service" is a direct expression of a "Deployment Intent". | 4 | The intent is structurally coherent, defining a service with a set of performance characteristics. | 2 | There is a significant internal contradiction. A service cannot be both "low priority" and support "mission-critical applications" with "deterministic performance." These are conflicting requirements. | 4 | The intent specifies the key QoS parameters but lacks a service or slice identifier (e.g., S-NSSAI) to be fully actionable. | 4.0 | A structurally sound intent that is severely undermined by a major logical inconsistency between its stated priority and application requirements. |
| 10 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 3hours automated key management. | 4 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method for 5G. However, `256_NEA2` is redundant; NEA2 *is* the 256-bit AES algorithm. The standard notation is just NEA2. | 4 | The intent combines three specific security parameters (authentication, encryption, key management), making it technically detailed. | 5 | The language is precise and uses standard acronyms, making it easily understandable and machine-readable. | 5 | Securing the network is a core tenet of assuring its performance and integrity. | 5 | The specified authentication, encryption, and key management policies form a logical and coherent security framework. | 5 | The components are all standard security mechanisms that work together. A 3-hour key rotation is an aggressive but valid policy. | 4 | The intent defines the security policy well but does not specify the scope (e.g., which UEs, NFs, or interfaces it applies to). | 4.6 | A strong and clear security intent, with a minor redundancy in terminology that doesn't affect its meaning. |
| 11 | Deployment Intent | Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 225.79ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics. | 4 | GBR and PDB are correct 3GPP terms. However, a 225ms PDB is very high for something labeled "mission-critical" and "deterministic," which usually implies low latency. | 4 | It specifies priority, GBR, PDB, and application type with multiple "mission-critical" qualifiers. | 4 | The intent is readable but the repetitive use of "mission-critical" is stylistically poor and adds little value. | 5 | "Launch...network service" directly corresponds to a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently defines a service with a specific set of QoS parameters. | 3 | While a GBR of 1Mbps can be for critical control messages, a PDB of 225.79ms is unusually high for a "mission-critical" service, which typically requires much lower latency (e.g., < 30ms). | 4 | Specifies key QoS parameters, but is missing a service or slice identifier (S-NSSAI) for targeting. | 4.1 | A clear deployment intent whose credibility is slightly undermined by an inconsistent PDB value for a "mission-critical" service. |
| 12 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 10 core utilization and 122GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This aligns perfectly with 3GPP management functions (like NWDAF or OAM) analyzing NF performance (AMF) using standard metrics (core/memory utilization). | 4 | The intent specifies the target (AMF), metrics, desired output (report with recommendations), making it moderately complex and specific. | 5 | The request is clearly structured and uses standard terminology, making it easily parsable. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Generate a report," which is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | All elements of the request are logically connected to form a single, coherent task for an analytics function. | 5 | The values (10 cores, 122GB memory) are plausible for an AMF instance under a specific load, and the request is internally consistent. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information (target, metrics, output format) for an analytics function to execute the request. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for generating a specific performance analytics report. |
| 13 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 128_NEA1 encryption with high-priority 19hours automated key management. | 5 | Certificate-based authentication is a valid method in 5G contexts (e.g., for certain NFs). 128-NEA1 (128-bit AES) is a standard 5G encryption algorithm. | 4 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters: authentication method, encryption algorithm, and a key rotation policy with priority. | 5 | The language is precise and uses standard terminology, making it very clear and machine-readable. | 5 | Defining security policies is a core part of performance assurance, ensuring the network is resilient and trustworthy. | 5 | The components form a coherent security policy for a specific use case. | 5 | The elements are consistent. A 19-hour key rotation is a reasonable, specific security policy. | 4 | The intent defines the security mechanisms well but does not specify the scope (e.g., where this policy should be applied). | 4.7 | A well-formed and technically correct intent that clearly defines a security policy for performance assurance. |
| 14 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 51 core utilization and 257GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting analytics on AMF performance using core and memory metrics is fully aligned with 3GPP/ETSI management frameworks. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF (AMF), metrics, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard technical terms. | 5 | The description's main verb, "Generate," perfectly aligns with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource usage and provide optimization recommendations is a logically sound and coherent workflow. | 5 | The specified resource values (51 cores, 257GB memory) are plausible for a very high-capacity AMF cluster, and the intent is internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information for an analytics function to fulfill the request. | 4.9 | An excellent and actionable intent for generating a detailed performance report. |
| 15 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 43 processing cores and 345GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core and memory allocation is a standard operation. However, "transport network optimization" is very vague and not directly tied to the resource allocation. | 4 | The intent combines specific resource modifications (cores, memory) with a broad, high-level goal ("transport network optimization"). | 4 | The first part of the sentence is clear, but the second part ("with transport network optimization") is ambiguous about what specific action is requested. | 5 | The verb "Modify" and the action of changing core/memory allocation align perfectly with "Modification Intent". | 3 | The coherence is weak. It's unclear how modifying compute resources for a core function directly achieves "transport network optimization" without more context. They are typically separate domains. | 4 | The intent is thematically consistent (network improvement) but lacks a clear, causal link between its two main clauses. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is too generic. It doesn't specify what to optimize (e.g., latency, bandwidth) or how. | 4.0 | A decent intent for resource modification that is weakened by a vague and poorly connected secondary goal. |
| 16 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 62 ARM64 processing cores at 2.15GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (ARM64), and clock speed are valid parameters for such an assessment. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) to be considered in the check. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and general requirements is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study of a high-performance NF. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of a network function deployment. |
| 17 | Modification Intent | Reconfigure Massive_MIMO_64T64R antenna systems with Vertical_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 5Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance. | 5 | All terms—Massive MIMO 64T64R, Vertical Beamforming, backhaul capacity—are correct and standard concepts in 3GPP RAN specifications. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying the exact MIMO configuration, a specific beamforming technique, and a backhaul upgrade. | 5 | The intent is technically dense but very clear and well-structured, making it perfectly readable for a RAN automation system. | 5 | The verb "Reconfigure" explicitly defines this as a "Modification Intent". | 5 | All components (MIMO system, beamforming type, backhaul) are logically interconnected parts of a RAN enhancement strategy. | 5 | The combination of Massive MIMO, vertical beamforming (useful in dense urban areas), and enhanced backhaul is a consistent and effective strategy for improving performance. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying what system to modify and the exact technical changes to apply. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a technically rich, standards-aligned, and actionable intent for RAN modification. |
| 18 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-3218-414] | 4 | EAP-AKA' is correct. `256_NEA1` is non-standard and likely a conflation of 256-bit keys (used in NEA2) and the NEA1 algorithm (which uses 128-bit keys). This is an error. | 3 | The intent specifies an authentication and encryption method, but the terminology for the latter is incorrect. | 2 | The intent contains a significant typo ("high-priorityout compromising") that breaks the sentence structure and hinders readability for both humans and machines. | 5 | The overall goal of securing infrastructure is highly relevant to "Performance Assurance". | 4 | The intent is thematically coherent (security), but the typo and incorrect term detract from its logical flow. | 4 | The goal of security without compromising performance is consistent, but the technical specification (256_NEA1) is not. | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the typo and the ambiguous/incorrect encryption algorithm. | 3.6 | A relevant intent that is significantly flawed by a typo and incorrect technical terminology. |
| 19 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant LSTM_Autoencoder anomaly detection with mission-critical 21% data sampling over 94days retention period. | 5 | The use of advanced analytics (LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection) and parameters like sampling and retention period are aligned with the capabilities of 3GPP's NWDAF. | 5 | This is a highly complex request specifying the ML model, its property (fault-tolerant), the sampling rate, and the data retention period. | 4 | The request is readable, but the term "intelligent analytics insights" is slightly generic. The rest of the parameters are clear. | 5 | The verb "Compile" and the request for "analytics insights" fit well within the "Intent Report Request" category. | 5 | The components (ML model, sampling, retention) are all logical parameters for configuring an advanced analytics and reporting task. | 5 | The parameters are consistent. A 21% sampling rate over a long retention period (94 days) is a plausible configuration for a deep learning analysis task. | 5 | The intent provides a complete set of parameters for configuring the analytics job. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically sophisticated intent for a complex analytics and reporting task. |
| 20 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 122 processing cores and 335GB memory allocation with high-priority 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | The parameters (cores, memory, timeout) and goals (performance, cost) are standard for resource management in virtualized environments, aligning with ETSI ZSM/NFV principles. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple resource dimensions, a constraint with priority, and high-level optimization goals. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and uses clear, unambiguous terms that are easily machine-parsable. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a direct match for a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The request to adjust resources, the constraints, and the optimization goals are all logically linked into a coherent instruction. | 5 | The parameters are internally consistent and represent a valid resource modification request for a large network function. | 4 | The intent is specific about the resource changes but lacks the target entity (e.g., a specific NF or service) to be fully complete. | 4.7 | A clear and actionable intent for resource modification, slightly missing the target context for full completeness. |
| 21 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 12GB HBM2 memory and 9648GB NVMe_SSD storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 5 | HBM2 (High Bandwidth Memory) and NVMe SSD are specific types of hardware. Evaluating their feasibility for a given workload is a valid and standards-aligned check. | 4 | The intent is specific, naming advanced hardware types (HBM2) and requesting a "deterministic performance" analysis, which is more complex than a standard one. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, using precise technical terms. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" directly corresponds to the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to evaluate specific hardware requirements and analyze the deterministic performance impact is a logical sequence for high-performance applications. | 5 | The parameters are consistent; HBM2 memory is often paired with large, fast storage for performance-critical workloads. | 4 | The check is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the application or network function it is for. | 4.7 | A strong, technically specific feasibility check suitable for high-performance computing environments. |
| 22 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 115 processing cores and 167GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying compute resources is standard. However, "transport network optimization" is vague and its connection to the compute resource change is unclear. | 4 | The intent combines a specific, quantitative change (cores, memory) with a very broad, qualitative goal. | 4 | The first clause is very clear, but the second ("with transport network optimization") is ambiguous and lacks actionable detail. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify...processing cores and memory," aligns perfectly with "Modification Intent". | 3 | The coherence is weak as there is no clear logical link provided between modifying a core NF's compute resources and optimizing the transport network. | 4 | While thematically related to network improvement, the two clauses address different domains (compute vs. transport) without a clear bridge, affecting consistency. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is not a specific, actionable instruction. | 3.9 | A clear resource modification intent that is significantly weakened by the inclusion of a vague and poorly connected secondary goal. |
| 23 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 4 processing cores and 203GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | This is a standard resource management intent, fully aligned with ETSI ZSM/NFV concepts. | 4 | Specifies multiple resource dimensions, a constraint, priority, and high-level goals. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easily parsable. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and precise description of a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The components (resource adjustment, constraints, goals) are logically connected into a coherent instruction. | 4 | The ratio of 4 cores to 203GB of memory is unusual. While possible for specific in-memory database applications, it's an atypical configuration for most network functions, slightly impacting consistency. | 4 | The intent is specific about the resource changes but lacks the target entity (e.g., a specific NF or service) to be fully complete. | 4.6 | A well-formed modification intent, though the specific resource ratio is slightly unconventional. |
| 24 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 418ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 5 | This aligns with the closed-loop automation principles of ETSI ZSM and 3GPP management, where analytics drive remediation to meet performance targets. | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (response time), a methodology (predictive analytics), and a required capability (automated remediation). | 5 | The intent is clearly stated, defining a goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The goal to "Optimize performance" by achieving a specific response time is a core example of a "Performance Assurance Intent". | 5 | The components (performance target, analytics, remediation) form a logical and complete closed-loop automation concept. | 5 | The elements are consistent; predictive analytics and automated remediation are the standard tools for proactively assuring performance targets like response time. | 5 | The intent is complete enough to define a high-level performance assurance policy. | 5.0 | An excellent example of a high-level, outcome-based intent for performance assurance using closed-loop automation. |
| 25 | Deployment Intent | Optimize cloud-native performance achieving 4072Mbps high-throughput targets and 36.9ms latency requirements through intelligent resource allocation and traffic optimization. | 4 | While performance optimization is a goal, this sounds more like a Performance Assurance or Modification intent rather than a new deployment. The action is "Optimize," not "Deploy." | 5 | This is a complex intent specifying multiple performance targets (throughput, latency) and the methods to achieve them (resource allocation, traffic optimization). | 5 | The intent is very clear, with specific, quantifiable performance targets. | 3 | The intent describes optimizing an existing system's performance ("achieving...targets") rather than deploying a new one. This is a mismatch with the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking the high-level goal (optimize performance) with specific targets and methods. | 5 | The targets (high throughput, medium latency) are consistent with an eMBB-type service, and the methods are appropriate. | 5 | The intent provides a complete set of goals and methods for a performance optimization task. | 4.6 | A very well-defined and clear intent for performance optimization, but it is misclassified as a Deployment Intent. |
| 26 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 3minutes/11minutes/53minutes multi-tier escalation through gRPC notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | Multi-tier escalation and specific notification channels (gRPC) are standard concepts in modern monitoring systems. "Intelligent routing" is a valid concept, though abstract here. | 4 | Specifies a complex escalation timeline, the notification channel, and a routing method with priority. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and uses standard terminology (gRPC, multi-tier escalation). | 4 | While it sets up a notification *system*, it doesn't specify the trigger conditions for the notifications themselves, making it slightly misaligned. It's more of a configuration intent. | 5 | The components (escalation timeline, channel, routing) are logically connected to define a notification delivery policy. | 5 | The parameters are consistent for setting up a robust, tiered alerting mechanism for critical systems. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it defines the "how" of notifications (escalation, channel) but not the "what" or "when" (the actual trigger conditions). | 4.3 | A good intent for configuring a notification mechanism, but it's incomplete as a standalone notification request because it lacks trigger conditions. |
| 27 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 13hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-3227-458] | 4 | 5G-AKA is correct. `256_NEA2` is redundant (NEA2 implies 256-bit). The phrasing ambiguously mixes reactive alerts (failures) with informational notifications (key rotation). | 3 | Specifies two trigger conditions and a third notification topic, but their relationship is unclear. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing, as it seems to conflate alerts on failures/breaches with notifications about key rotation events. | 5 | The primary request to be alerted on security events aligns well with the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak because it joins two distinct notification types (reactive alerts and scheduled event notifications) without a clear logical link. | 4 | All components are related to security, making them thematically consistent, but the structure is disjointed. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is not defined. | 3.6 | A relevant notification intent that is significantly hampered by ambiguous phrasing and poor coherence between its clauses. |
| 28 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 34 RISC_V processing cores at 2.47GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (RISC-V), and clock speed are appropriate parameters for such a check. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) along with performance constraints. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study, especially with the growing interest in RISC-V for specific workloads. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of deploying an NF on an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 29 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-3229-477] | 5 | Using throughput and latency as KPIs for performance monitoring and alerting is fully aligned with 3GPP and ETSI ZSM standards. | 3 | This describes a common but essential monitoring pattern: two performance conditions triggering an action. | 5 | The trigger conditions and the requested action are stated clearly and unambiguously. | 5 | This is a classic example of a "Regular Notification Request," asking to be alerted based on specific performance events. | 5 | The structure is logical: a set of conditions (performance degradation) triggers a specific action (alert and escalate). | 5 | The performance targets (1Gbps throughput, 5ms latency) are consistent with high-performance services. | 4 | The intent is clear but uses generic terms like "thresholds" and "acceptable limits" instead of specific values, making it slightly less complete. | 4.6 | A very clear, practical, and well-formed intent for performance monitoring and alerting. |
| 30 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 12hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol. `256_NEA1` is non-standard and likely an error for NEA2 (256-bit AES) as NEA1 is 128-bit. The sentence structure is also confusing. | 3 | It specifies two alert triggers and a separate notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types (reactive vs. informational) without a clear logical connection. | 3 | The technical specification for the encryption algorithm (256_NEA1) is inconsistent with 3GPP standards. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the link between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is undefined, and the encryption term is incorrect. | 3.4 | A relevant intent that is significantly flawed by incorrect technical terminology and an incoherent sentence structure. |
| 31 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 10hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is valid. `128_NEA2` is a contradiction: NEA2 uses a 256-bit key, not 128-bit. This is a technical error. The sentence structure is also confusing. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but contains a technical error and ambiguous phrasing. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types without a clear logical connection. | 2 | The technical specification `128_NEA2` is a direct contradiction of 3GPP standards (NEA2 is 256-bit), making it highly inconsistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the undefined link between alerts and notifications, and is technically incorrect. | 3.3 | A relevant intent that is severely flawed by a direct technical contradiction in its parameters and an incoherent sentence structure. |
| 32 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol. 128-NEA3 (128-bit ZUC) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm. The sentence structure, however, remains confusing. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous about their relationship. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types without a clear logical connection. | 5 | The technical parameters (EAP-TLS, 128-NEA3) are individually correct and consistent with 3GPP standards. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the link between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is undefined. | 3.9 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that suffers from a lack of coherence and completeness in its description. |
| 33 | Deployment Intent | Deploy enterprise-grade UPF network function using Ericsson SW_1.4.229 software on high-performance 1-core x86_64 architecture with high-priority 5GB DDR4 memory and 296GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability. | 5 | UPF is a standard 5G Core NF. Specifying vendor, SW version, architecture (x86_64), memory, and storage are all standard parameters in NFV deployments. | 5 | This is a highly detailed intent specifying the NF, vendor, SW version, hardware architecture, and specific resource allocations with priority. | 5 | The intent is structured as a clear command with all necessary parameters, ideal for automation. | 5 | The description to "Deploy" a specific network function is a textbook example of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | All the specified parameters logically contribute to a single, coherent instruction for deploying a network function. | 4 | A 1-core allocation for a high-performance UPF seems unusually low, as UPFs are data plane elements that typically require significant processing power. It's plausible for a very small-scale or specific use case, but slightly inconsistent with "high-performance". | 5 | This intent provides a rich set of details, making it very complete and directly actionable by an orchestrator. | 4.9 | An excellent and detailed deployment intent, with a slightly questionable (though not impossible) resource allocation choice. |
| 34 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 405GB LPDDR5 memory and 3746GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | This aligns with the concept of feasibility checks in orchestration systems. LPDDR5 and NVMe SSD are standard hardware components. | 3 | The intent is straightforward, asking to evaluate two resource parameters and their performance impact. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" directly maps to the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to evaluate resource requirements and then analyze the performance impact is a logical sequence. | 5 | The parameters are consistent; it's a valid request to check the feasibility of allocating a large amount of memory and storage. | 4 | It's a well-defined check, but it would be more complete if it specified the context, such as the network function or service being deployed. | 4.6 | A clear and practical feasibility check, useful for resource planning before a deployment. |
| 35 | Deployment Intent | Execute research-grade sophisticated with mission-critical cutting-edge innovations ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications network slice deployment featuring Massive_MIMO_32T32R antenna systems with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated 3D_Beamforming beamforming capabilities across 700MHz/3.5GHz/28GHz spectrum bands, optimized for Dense_Urban coverage scenarios. | 5 | All technical terms (URLLC, Massive MIMO 32T32R, 3D Beamforming, spectrum bands, Dense Urban) are correct and aligned with 3GPP standards for 5G network slicing and RAN. | 5 | This is an extremely complex intent, specifying a slice type (URLLC), RAN technology, beamforming, multiple spectrum bands, and a coverage scenario. | 2 | The readability is poor due to excessive, repetitive, and unhelpful adjectives like "research-grade sophisticated," "mission-critical," and "cutting-edge innovations." This makes it difficult to parse. | 5 | The core request is for a "network slice deployment," which clearly matches the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | Despite the verbose language, the underlying technical components (slice, MIMO, beamforming, spectrum) are logically connected for a URLLC deployment. | 5 | The chosen technologies (Massive MIMO, 3D Beamforming) and spectrum bands are consistent with deploying a high-performance URLLC slice in a dense urban environment. | 5 | The intent is technically very complete, providing all the key parameters for a slice deployment. | 4.6 | A technically excellent and complete intent that is severely let down by poor readability due to excessive marketing-style adjectives. |
| 36 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 23 ARM64 processing cores at 2.86GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (ARM64), and clock speed are valid parameters for such an assessment. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF) and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) to be considered in the check. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and general requirements is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study of a high-performance NF. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of a network function deployment. |
| 37 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 120 processing cores and 168GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying compute resources is standard. However, "transport network optimization" is vague and its connection to the compute resource change is unclear. The "mission-critical" qualifier on it adds urgency but not clarity. | 4 | The intent combines a specific, quantitative change (cores, memory) with a very broad, qualitative goal that has been given a high priority. | 4 | The first clause is very clear, but the second ("with...transport network optimization") is ambiguous and lacks actionable detail. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify...processing cores and memory," aligns perfectly with "Modification Intent". | 3 | The coherence is weak as there is no clear logical link provided between modifying a core NF's compute resources and optimizing the transport network. They are typically modified independently. | 4 | While thematically related to network improvement, the two clauses address different domains (compute vs. transport) without a clear bridge, affecting consistency. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is not a specific, actionable instruction, even with a "mission-critical" tag. | 3.9 | A clear resource modification intent that is significantly weakened by the inclusion of a vague and poorly connected secondary goal. |
| 38 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 74 x86_64 processing cores at 1.75GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (x86_64), and clock speed are valid parameters for such an assessment. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF) and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) to be considered in the check. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and general requirements is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent. A lower clock speed (1.75GHz) with a high core count (74) is a common configuration in server CPUs, making this a realistic scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of a network function deployment. |
| 39 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 91 processing cores and 334GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | This is a standard resource management intent, fully aligned with ETSI ZSM/NFV concepts. | 4 | Specifies multiple resource dimensions, a constraint with priority, and high-level goals. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easily parsable. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and precise description of a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The components (resource adjustment, constraints, goals) are logically connected into a coherent instruction. | 5 | The parameters are internally consistent and represent a valid resource modification request for a large network function. | 4 | The intent is specific about the resource changes but lacks the target entity (e.g., a specific NF or service) to be fully complete. | 4.7 | A clear and actionable intent for resource modification, slightly missing the target context for full completeness. |
| 40 | Modification Intent | Update QoS flow 5QI_85_Electricity_Distribution_High_Voltage configuration with 4078Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality. | 4 | 5QI (5G QoS Identifier) is a standard 3GPP concept. However, 5QI 85 is for High Voltage Electricity Distribution, which is a critical control service and would not have a 4 Gbps maximum bitrate. This is a major inconsistency. | 4 | The intent is specific, targeting a particular 5QI and specifying a maximum bitrate. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and easy to parse. | 5 | The action "Update...configuration" is a clear match for a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The structure is coherent: it identifies a QoS flow and specifies a parameter to modify. | 1 | The intent is highly inconsistent. 5QI 85 is designed for low-bandwidth, high-reliability SCADA-type traffic. A bitrate of 4078 Mbps is completely inappropriate and contradicts the purpose of this standardized 5QI. | 4 | The intent is actionable but based on a flawed premise. It's missing context on which PDU sessions or UEs this applies to. | 4.0 | A structurally sound intent that is rendered nonsensical by a severe logical inconsistency between the chosen 5QI and the specified bitrate. |
| 41 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 62 core utilization and 30GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting analytics on AMF performance using core and memory metrics is fully aligned with 3GPP/ETSI management frameworks. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF (AMF), metrics, priority, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard technical terms. | 5 | The description's main verb, "Generate," perfectly aligns with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource usage and provide optimization recommendations is a logically sound and coherent workflow. | 4 | The ratio of 62 cores to only 30GB of memory is unusual for a general-purpose NF like AMF, which is more control-plane intensive. It's not impossible but is an atypical configuration. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information for an analytics function to fulfill the request. | 4.7 | An excellent and actionable intent for generating a detailed performance report, with slightly unconventional resource values being analyzed. |
| 42 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 8hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is correct. `256_NEA1` is non-standard and likely a conflation of 256-bit keys (used in NEA2) and the NEA1 algorithm (which uses 128-bit keys). This is an error. | 3 | The intent specifies two alert triggers and a separate notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous and contains a technical error. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types (reactive vs. informational) without a clear logical connection. | 3 | The technical specification for the encryption algorithm (256_NEA1) is inconsistent with 3GPP standards. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the link between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is undefined, and the encryption term is incorrect. | 3.4 | A relevant intent that is significantly flawed by incorrect technical terminology and an incoherent sentence structure. |
| 43 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 49 core utilization and 435GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting analytics on AMF performance using core and memory metrics is fully aligned with 3GPP/ETSI management frameworks. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF (AMF), metrics, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard technical terms. | 5 | The description's main verb, "Generate," perfectly aligns with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource usage and provide optimization recommendations is a logically sound and coherent workflow. | 5 | The specified resource values (49 cores, 435GB memory) are plausible for a high-capacity AMF cluster, and the intent is internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information for an analytics function to fulfill the request. | 4.9 | An excellent and actionable intent for generating a detailed performance report. |
| 44 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 103 core utilization and 410GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This aligns with 3GPP management functions. The addition of "deterministic performance" suggests a focus on latency variation (jitter) and tail-end performance, which is a valid and advanced analysis type. | 4 | Specifies the target (AMF), metrics, a specific analysis type ("deterministic"), and the desired output. | 5 | The request is clear and well-structured. "Deterministic performance" is a slightly advanced but understandable term in this context. | 5 | The request to "Generate a report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | All elements of the request are logically connected to form a single, coherent task for an advanced analytics function. | 5 | The high core count (103) and large memory (410GB) are consistent with a workload where deterministic performance is a major concern. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information (target, metrics, analysis type, output format) for an analytics function to execute the request. | 4.9 | An excellent, advanced reporting intent that correctly specifies a more nuanced type of performance analysis. |
| 45 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 2 processing cores and 510GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | This is a standard resource management intent, fully aligned with ETSI ZSM/NFV concepts. | 4 | Specifies multiple resource dimensions, a constraint with priority, and high-level goals. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easily parsable. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and precise description of a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The components (resource adjustment, constraints, goals) are logically connected into a coherent instruction. | 3 | The ratio of 2 cores to 510GB of memory is extremely unusual and highly imbalanced for almost any network function. This is likely an error or a very niche, specific use case, which makes it seem inconsistent. | 4 | The intent is specific about the resource changes but lacks the target entity (e.g., a specific NF or service) to be fully complete. | 4.4 | A well-formed modification intent, but the specified resource ratio is extremely unconventional and likely unrealistic, which harms its consistency. |
| 46 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 111 ARM64 processing cores at 1.6GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (ARM64), and clock speed are valid parameters for such an assessment. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), priority, and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed). | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and general requirements is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent. A very high core count (111) at a low clock speed (1.6GHz) is a realistic configuration for some modern ARM-based server CPUs. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of a network function deployment. |
| 47 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 100 RISC_V processing cores at 2.77GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (RISC-V), clock speed, and priority are appropriate parameters for such a check. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), priority, and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed). | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study, especially with the growing interest in RISC-V for specific workloads. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of deploying an NF on an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 48 | Deployment Intent | Implement advanced 3_Sector antenna sectorization optimized for Urban_Macro deployment scenarios, maximizing spectral efficiency and user experience quality. | 5 | Antenna sectorization (e.g., 3-sector cells) and deployment scenarios (Urban Macro) are fundamental and standard concepts in 3GPP RAN design. | 4 | The intent specifies the sectorization scheme, the deployment scenario, and the high-level optimization goals. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and uses standard RAN engineering terminology. | 5 | The verb "Implement" for a new antenna configuration is a valid expression of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The components (sectorization, scenario, goals) are all logically connected to define a RAN deployment strategy. | 5 | A 3-sector configuration is the most common and standard approach for Urban Macro cells, making this intent highly consistent with best practices. | 5 | The intent provides a complete high-level instruction for a common RAN deployment pattern. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a clear, standards-aligned, and practical intent for RAN deployment. |
| 49 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 96 core utilization and 135GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting analytics on AMF performance using core and memory metrics is fully aligned with 3GPP/ETSI management frameworks. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF (AMF), metrics, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard technical terms. | 5 | The description's main verb, "Generate," perfectly aligns with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource usage and provide optimization recommendations is a logically sound and coherent workflow. | 5 | The specified resource values (96 cores, 135GB memory) are plausible for a high-capacity AMF cluster, and the intent is internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information for an analytics function to fulfill the request. | 4.9 | An excellent and actionable intent for generating a detailed performance report. |
| 50 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 104 core utilization and 304GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting analytics on AMF performance using core and memory metrics is fully aligned with 3GPP/ETSI management frameworks. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF (AMF), metrics, priority, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard technical terms. | 5 | The description's main verb, "Generate," perfectly aligns with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource usage and provide optimization recommendations is a logically sound and coherent workflow. | 5 | The specified resource values (104 cores, 304GB memory) are plausible for a very high-capacity AMF cluster, and the intent is internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information for an analytics function to fulfill the request. | 4.9 | An excellent and actionable intent for generating a detailed performance report. |
| 51 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 354GB LPDDR5 memory and 5901GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | This aligns with the concept of feasibility checks. LPDDR5 and SATA SSD are standard hardware components. | 3 | The intent is straightforward, asking to evaluate two resource parameters and their performance impact. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" directly maps to the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to evaluate resource requirements and then analyze the performance impact is a logical sequence. | 4 | While possible, pairing LPDDR5 (low-power memory, common in edge/mobile) with a large, slower SATA SSD (rather than NVMe) is a slightly unusual combination for a high-performance system, affecting consistency. | 4 | It's a well-defined check, but it would be more complete if it specified the context, such as the network function or service being deployed. | 4.4 | A clear feasibility check, although the specific combination of hardware components is somewhat unconventional. |
| 52 | Deployment Intent | Deploy enterprise-grade NWDAF network function using Ericsson SW_2.9.384 software on high-deterministic performance 4-core ARM64 architecture with high-priority 58GB DDR4 memory and 555GB SATA_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability. | 5 | NWDAF is a standard 5G Core NF (3GPP TS 23.288). Specifying vendor, SW version, architecture, memory, and storage are all standard parameters in NFV deployments. | 5 | This is a highly detailed intent specifying the NF, vendor, SW version, hardware architecture, and specific resource allocations with priority. | 4 | The phrase "high-deterministic performance 4-core" is slightly awkward. It should be "on a 4-core... architecture for high deterministic performance." | 5 | The description to "Deploy" a specific network function is a textbook example of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | All the specified parameters logically contribute to a single, coherent instruction for deploying a network function. | 4 | A SATA SSD is a reasonable choice, but for "high-deterministic performance," a faster NVMe SSD would be a more consistent storage choice. | 5 | This intent provides a rich set of details, making it very complete and directly actionable by an orchestrator. | 4.7 | An excellent, detailed deployment intent, with slightly awkward phrasing and a minor inconsistency in the storage choice for a high-performance goal. |
| 53 | Deployment Intent | Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 93Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 3.99ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics. | 5 | The use of GBR and PDB aligns with 3GPP TS 23.501 for QoS. The values (93Mbps GBR, 3.99ms PDB) are consistent with a URLLC-type service. | 4 | Specifies priority, GBR, PDB, and application type with qualifiers. | 3 | The repetitive use of "mission-critical" and "deterministic" is redundant and poor style, harming readability. | 5 | "Launch network service" is a direct expression of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The intent coherently defines a service with a specific set of QoS parameters suitable for critical applications. | 5 | The parameters (high GBR, very low PDB) are highly consistent with the "critical priority" and "mission-critical" descriptors. | 4 | Specifies key QoS parameters, but is missing a service or slice identifier (S-NSSAI) to be fully actionable. | 4.4 | A technically sound and consistent intent for a URLLC service, but its readability is poor due to excessive, repetitive adjectives. |
| 54 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 78 core utilization and 259GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting analytics on AMF performance using core and memory metrics is fully aligned with 3GPP/ETSI management frameworks. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF (AMF), metrics, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard technical terms. | 5 | The description's main verb, "Generate," perfectly aligns with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource usage and provide optimization recommendations is a logically sound and coherent workflow. | 5 | The specified resource values (78 cores, 259GB memory) are plausible for a high-capacity AMF cluster, and the intent is internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information for an analytics function to fulfill the request. | 4.9 | An excellent and actionable intent for generating a detailed performance report. |
| 55 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure deterministic performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with high-priority 24hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method. However, `128_NEA2` is a contradiction: NEA2 is the algorithm for 256-bit keys, not 128-bit. This is a technical error. | 4 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters (authentication, encryption, key management) with a priority level. | 5 | Despite the technical error, the intent is phrased clearly and is easy to read. | 5 | Securing the network is a core part of performance assurance. | 5 | The components form a coherent security policy structure. | 2 | The specification of `128_NEA2` is a direct contradiction of the 3GPP standard where NEA2 is explicitly 256-bit, making it highly inconsistent. | 4 | The intent defines most of a security policy but is flawed by the incorrect encryption parameter. It also lacks scope. | 4.1 | A well-structured intent that is critically flawed by an incorrect and contradictory technical parameter for encryption. |
| 56 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 75 core utilization and 116GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting analytics on AMF performance using core and memory metrics is fully aligned with 3GPP/ETSI management frameworks. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF (AMF), metrics, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard technical terms. | 5 | The description's main verb, "Generate," perfectly aligns with the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The request to analyze resource usage and provide optimization recommendations is a logically sound and coherent workflow. | 5 | The specified resource values (75 cores, 116GB memory) are plausible for a high-capacity AMF cluster, and the intent is internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information for an analytics function to fulfill the request. | 4.9 | An excellent and actionable intent for generating a detailed performance report. |
| 57 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-3257-631] | 4 | EAP-AKA' is correct. `256_NEA1` is non-standard and likely a conflation of 256-bit keys (used in NEA2) and the NEA1 algorithm (which uses 128-bit keys). This is an error. | 3 | The intent specifies an authentication and encryption method, but the terminology for the latter is incorrect. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and easy to understand. | 5 | The goal of securing infrastructure is highly relevant to "Performance Assurance". | 4 | The intent is thematically coherent (security), but the incorrect technical term detracts from its logical correctness. | 3 | The technical specification for the encryption algorithm (256_NEA1) is inconsistent with 3GPP standards. | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the ambiguous/incorrect encryption algorithm and lack of detail on key management. | 3.9 | A relevant intent with a clear goal, but it is undermined by incorrect technical terminology for the encryption protocol. |
| 58 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms.

[Instance-3293-896] | 5 | Certificate-based authentication and 128-NEA3 (128-bit ZUC) are valid 3GPP security concepts. The sentence structure, however, is confusing. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous about their relationship. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types without a clear logical connection. | 5 | The technical parameters are individually correct and consistent with 3GPP standards. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the link between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is undefined. | 3.9 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that suffers from a lack of coherence and completeness in its description. |

| 101 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 23hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is correct. `256_NEA2` is redundant (NEA2 implies 256-bit). The sentence structure is confusing, mixing reactive alerts with informational notifications. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous and contains a minor redundancy. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing as it seems to conflate alerts on failures/breaches with notifications about key rotation events. | 5 | The primary request to be alerted on security events aligns well with the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak because it joins two distinct notification types (reactive alerts and scheduled event notifications) without a clear logical link. | 5 | The technical parameters are correct and consistent with 3GPP standards (ignoring the redundancy). | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is not defined. | 3.7 | A relevant notification intent that is significantly hampered by ambiguous phrasing and poor coherence between its clauses. |

[Instance-3304-991] | 5 | This aligns with NWDAF concepts, using advanced ML models (LSTM Autoencoder) for anomaly detection in a specific service type (eMBB). | 5 | This is a complex intent specifying the service to monitor (eMBB), the detection algorithm (LSTM Autoencoder), and the action (proactive alerting). | 4 | The term "high-high-throughput" is a typo/redundancy. The rest of the intent is clear and readable. | 4 | The intent is to "Configure" a monitoring system, which is a prerequisite for notifications but not a request for a notification itself. It's more of a configuration intent. | 5 | The components (service type, monitoring method, alerting goal) are logically connected to define a monitoring policy. | 5 | Using an LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection on eMBB performance metrics is a consistent and valid advanced approach. | 5 | The intent provides a complete description of the monitoring configuration requested. | 4.7 | An excellent, technically rich intent for configuring an advanced monitoring service, slightly misclassified as a direct notification request. |

[Instance-3305-1007] | 5 | Using throughput and latency as KPIs for performance monitoring and alerting is fully aligned with 3GPP and ETSI ZSM standards. | 3 | This describes a common but essential monitoring pattern: two performance conditions triggering an action. | 5 | The trigger conditions and the requested action are stated clearly and unambiguously. | 5 | This is a classic example of a "Regular Notification Request," asking to be alerted based on specific performance events. | 5 | The structure is logical: a set of conditions (performance degradation) triggers a specific action (alert and escalate). | 5 | The performance targets (1Gbps throughput, 5ms latency) are consistent with high-performance services. | 4 | The intent is clear but uses generic terms like "thresholds" and "acceptable limits" instead of specific values, making it slightly less complete. | 4.6 | A very clear, practical, and well-formed intent for performance monitoring and alerting. |
| 106 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 41 core utilization and 123GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This aligns with 3GPP management functions. The addition of "deterministic performance" suggests a focus on latency variation (jitter) and tail-end performance, which is a valid and advanced analysis type. | 4 | Specifies the target (AMF), metrics, a specific analysis type ("deterministic"), and the desired output. | 5 | The request is clear and well-structured. "Deterministic performance" is a slightly advanced but understandable term in this context. | 5 | The request to "Generate a report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | All elements of the request are logically connected to form a single, coherent task for an advanced analytics function. | 5 | The resource configuration is consistent with a workload where deterministic performance is a major concern. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information (target, metrics, analysis type, output format) for an analytics function to execute the request. | 4.9 | An excellent, advanced reporting intent that correctly specifies a more nuanced type of performance analysis. |
| 107 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-deterministic performance compute resources with mission-critical 18 x86_64 cores and 54GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Provisioning compute resources with specific architectures and memory types is a standard NFV deployment task. | 4 | Specifies core count, architecture, memory, and a performance characteristic ("high-deterministic"). | 4 | The phrasing "high-deterministic performance compute resources" is slightly awkward but understandable. | 5 | "Provision...compute resources" is a clear expression of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The specified resources and the target goal ("demanding network functions") are logically connected. | 5 | The resource allocation (18 cores, 54GB RAM) is a very common and consistent size for a virtualized network function. | 4 | The intent is slightly incomplete as it doesn't name the specific network function(s) to be deployed on these resources. | 4.6 | A good, clear intent for resource provisioning, slightly lacking in specifics about the consumer of the resources. |
| 108 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 34 processing cores and 288GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying compute resources is standard. However, "transport network optimization" is vague and its connection to the compute resource change is unclear. | 4 | The intent combines a specific, quantitative change (cores, memory) with a very broad, qualitative goal. | 4 | The first clause is very clear, but the second ("with transport network optimization") is ambiguous and lacks actionable detail. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify...processing cores and memory," aligns perfectly with "Modification Intent". | 3 | The coherence is weak as there is no clear logical link provided between modifying a core NF's compute resources and optimizing the transport network. | 4 | While thematically related to network improvement, the two clauses address different domains (compute vs. transport) without a clear bridge, affecting consistency. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is not a specific, actionable instruction. | 3.9 | A clear resource modification intent that is significantly weakened by the inclusion of a vague and poorly connected secondary goal. |
| 109 | Deployment Intent | Launch medium priority network service guaranteeing 500Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 10.88ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics. | 4 | The use of GBR and PDB is correct per 3GPP TS 23.501. The values are specific and plausible for a high-quality service. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple QoS parameters (priority, GBR, PDB) and the target application type. | 5 | The description is clearly written and easy to parse, with specific numerical values. | 5 | "Launch network service" is a direct expression of a "Deployment Intent". | 4 | The intent is structurally coherent, defining a service with a set of performance characteristics. | 3 | There is an internal contradiction. A service described as "medium priority" would not typically be used for "mission-critical applications." These terms imply different levels of importance. | 4 | The intent specifies the key QoS parameters but lacks a service or slice identifier (e.g., S-NSSAI) to be fully actionable. | 4.1 | A well-structured intent that is undermined by a logical inconsistency between its stated priority and the target application type. |
| 110 | Deployment Intent | Secure multi-domain orchestration using HMAC_SHA256 key derivation functions with 256_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 18hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle. | 5 | HMAC-SHA256 is a standard cryptographic function. Key rotation policies are a fundamental security best practice. This aligns with secure orchestration principles. | 5 | This is a complex security policy intent, specifying the algorithm, key size, and rotation schedule for multi-domain orchestration. | 5 | The intent is technically specific but clearly written and easy to understand. | 4 | This describes the configuration of a security mechanism *for* orchestration, rather than the deployment of a network service itself. It's more of a security configuration intent. | 5 | The components (algorithm, key size, rotation) form a complete and coherent security policy. | 5 | All the specified security parameters are consistent with modern cryptographic best practices. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary parameters to configure the security mechanism. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically detailed intent for configuring a security policy, although its classification as a "Deployment Intent" is borderline. |
| 111 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 27 processing cores and 221GB memory allocation with high-priority transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying compute resources is standard. However, "transport network optimization" is vague and its connection to the compute resource change is unclear. | 4 | The intent combines a specific, quantitative change (cores, memory) with a very broad, qualitative goal that has been given a high priority. | 4 | The first clause is very clear, but the second ("with...transport network optimization") is ambiguous and lacks actionable detail. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify...processing cores and memory," aligns perfectly with "Modification Intent". | 3 | The coherence is weak as there is no clear logical link provided between modifying a core NF's compute resources and optimizing the transport network. | 4 | While thematically related to network improvement, the two clauses address different domains (compute vs. transport) without a clear bridge, affecting consistency. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is not a specific, actionable instruction, even with a "high-priority" tag. | 3.9 | A clear resource modification intent that is significantly weakened by the inclusion of a vague and poorly connected secondary goal. |
| 112 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 15hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary 5G authentication method. 128-NEA3 (128-bit ZUC) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm. The sentence structure, however, remains confusing. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous about their relationship. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types without a clear logical connection. | 5 | The technical parameters (5G-AKA, 128-NEA3) are individually correct and consistent with 3GPP standards. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the link between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is undefined. | 3.9 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that suffers from a lack of coherence and completeness in its description. |
| 113 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps throughput deterministic performance drops below thresholds or 5ms ultra-low latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-3313-1047] | 5 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. Adding qualifiers like "deterministic" and "ultra-low" specifies a stricter monitoring context, which is valid and aligned with URLLC concepts. | 4 | The intent is similar to a standard performance alert but adds qualifiers ("deterministic," "ultra-low") that increase its specificity. | 5 | The trigger conditions and the requested action are stated clearly and unambiguously. | 5 | This is a classic example of a "Regular Notification Request," asking for an alert based on specific performance events. | 5 | The structure is logical: a set of conditions (performance degradation) triggers a specific action (alert and escalate). | 5 | The performance targets (1Gbps, 5ms) and qualifiers are consistent with a high-performance, latency-sensitive service (e.g., URLLC). | 4 | The intent is clear but uses generic terms like "thresholds" and "acceptable limits" instead of specific values, making it slightly less complete. | 4.7 | A very clear and well-formed intent for monitoring a high-performance, latency-sensitive service. |
| 114 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 76 processing cores and 213GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying compute resources is standard. However, "transport network optimization" is vague and its connection to the compute resource change is unclear. | 4 | The intent combines a specific, quantitative change (cores, memory) with a very broad, qualitative goal. | 4 | The first clause is very clear, but the second ("with transport network optimization") is ambiguous and lacks actionable detail. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify...processing cores and memory," aligns perfectly with "Modification Intent". | 3 | The coherence is weak as there is no clear logical link provided between modifying a core NF's compute resources and optimizing the transport network. | 4 | While thematically related to network improvement, the two clauses address different domains (compute vs. transport) without a clear bridge, affecting consistency. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is not a specific, actionable instruction. | 3.9 | A clear resource modification intent that is significantly weakened by the inclusion of a vague and poorly connected secondary goal. |
| 115 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 15GB HBM2 memory and 703GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | This aligns with pre-deployment checks. HBM2 and Optane are specific, high-performance hardware types, making a feasibility check highly relevant. | 4 | The intent is specific, naming two distinct types of advanced memory/storage and requesting a performance analysis. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, using precise technical terms. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" directly corresponds to the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to evaluate specific hardware requirements and analyze the performance impact is a logical sequence. | 5 | The parameters are consistent; combining HBM2 (for compute) and Optane (for fast storage) is a plausible architecture for a high-performance computing node. | 4 | The check is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the application or network function it is for. | 4.7 | A strong, technically specific feasibility check suitable for very high-performance workloads. |
| 116 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 21hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based auth is valid. `256_NEA2` is redundant (NEA2 implies 256-bit). The sentence structure is confusing, mixing reactive alerts with informational notifications. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous and contains a minor redundancy. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing as it seems to conflate alerts on failures/breaches with notifications about key rotation events. | 5 | The primary request to be alerted on security events aligns well with the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The coherence is weak because it joins two distinct notification types (reactive alerts and scheduled event notifications) without a clear logical link. | 5 | The technical parameters are correct and consistent with 3GPP standards (ignoring the redundancy). | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the relationship between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is not defined. | 3.7 | A relevant notification intent that is significantly hampered by ambiguous phrasing and poor coherence between its clauses. |
| 117 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 100 processing cores and 315GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | This is a standard resource management intent, fully aligned with ETSI ZSM/NFV concepts. | 4 | Specifies multiple resource dimensions, a constraint, and high-level goals. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easily parsable. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and precise description of a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The components (resource adjustment, constraints, goals) are logically connected into a coherent instruction. | 5 | The parameters are internally consistent and represent a valid resource modification request for a large network function. | 4 | The intent is specific about the resource changes but lacks the target entity (e.g., a specific NF or service) to be fully complete. | 4.7 | A clear and actionable intent for resource modification, slightly missing the target context for full completeness. |
| 118 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 16hours automated key management. | 4 | 5G-AKA is correct. `256_NEA2` is redundant; NEA2 *is* the 256-bit AES algorithm.

| 119 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 18hours automated key management. | 4 | Certificate-based auth is valid. `256_NEA2` is redundant as NEA2 implies 256-bit. | 4 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters: authentication method, encryption algorithm, and a key rotation policy. | 5 | The language is precise and uses standard terminology, making it very clear and machine-readable. | 5 | Defining security policies is a core part of performance assurance. | 5 | The components form a coherent security policy for a specific use case. | 5 | The elements are consistent.

"Deterministic performance" is a slightly advanced but understandable term in this context. | 5 | The request to "Generate a report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | All elements of the request are logically connected to form a single, coherent task for an advanced analytics function. | 5 | The resource configuration is consistent with a workload where deterministic performance is a major concern. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information (target, metrics, analysis type, output format) for an analytics function to execute the request. | 4.9 | An excellent, advanced reporting intent that correctly specifies a more nuanced type of performance analysis. |
| 123 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 102 x86_64 processing cores at 1.9GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard pre-deployment check.

[Instance-3325-1120] | 5 | This aligns with NWDAF concepts, using ML models (Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection in a specific service type (URLLC). | 5 | This is a complex intent specifying the service to monitor (URLLC), the detection algorithm (Isolation Forest), and the action (proactive alerting for deterministic performance). | 3 | The term "ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency" is a typo/exaggeration. Standard term is URLLC. This harms readability. | 4 | The intent is to "Configure" a monitoring system, which is a prerequisite for notifications but not a request for a notification itself. It's more of a configuration intent. | 5 | The components (service type, monitoring method, alerting goal) are logically connected to define a monitoring policy. | 5 | Using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection on URLLC performance metrics is a consistent and valid approach. | 5 | The intent provides a complete description of the monitoring configuration requested. | 4.6 | An excellent, technically rich intent for configuring advanced monitoring, slightly misclassified and marred by a typo in the service name. |

| 130 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 13hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is valid. `128_NEA2` is a contradiction: NEA2 uses a 256-bit key, not 128-bit. This is a technical error. The sentence structure is also confusing. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but contains a technical error and ambiguous phrasing. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types without a clear logical connection. | 2 | The technical specification `128_NEA2` is a direct contradiction of 3GPP standards (NEA2 is 256-bit), making it highly inconsistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the undefined link between alerts and notifications, and is technically incorrect. | 3.3 | A relevant intent that is severely flawed by a direct technical contradiction in its parameters and an incoherent sentence structure. |
| 131 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize deterministic performance achieving 250ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 5 | This aligns with closed-loop automation principles (ETSI ZSM).

However, `256_NEA1` is non-standard and likely an error for NEA2 (256-bit AES). | 4 | The intent is complex, asking to analyze the impact of two different factors (device density and security overhead) on the system. | 5 | The request is clear and understandable, despite the technical error in the security algorithm name. | 5 | The verb "Consider" (in the context of impact) aligns well with the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to check the impact of both device density and security overhead is a coherent part of a system-level feasibility study. | 3 | The security parameter `256_NEA1` is inconsistent with 3GPP standards, where NEA1 is 128-bit. | 4 | The intent is slightly incomplete as it doesn't specify which "system" or NF is being evaluated. | 4.3 | A good, complex feasibility check that is weakened by a technical error in the security parameter naming. |

| 139 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is valid. `128_NEA2` is a contradiction: NEA2 uses a 256-bit key, not 128-bit. This is a technical error.

| 140 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 16 ARM64 processing cores at 3.13GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (ARM64), and clock speed are valid parameters for such an assessment. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF) and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) to be considered in the check. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and general requirements is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study of a standard NF deployment. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of a network function deployment. |

| 143 | Performance Assurance Intent | Configure 198ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.00747 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms. | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate are standard QoS parameters defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. | 4 | The intent specifies two key QoS parameters with priority, and the high-level method to achieve them. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated with specific, quantifiable targets. | 5 | The goal is to "Configure" specific performance parameters (PDB, error rate), which is a core part of "Performance Assurance". | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired QoS outcomes with the necessary implementation methods (traffic engineering, QA). | 4 | A PDB of 198ms is very high for something labeled "mission-critical," which usually implies low latency. However, for some non-real-time critical services (like remote metering), it could be plausible. | 4 | The intent is specific about the targets but lacks the context of which service or slice this configuration applies to. | 4.6 | A strong and clear intent for configuring QoS parameters, with a slightly questionable PDB value for a mission-critical service. |
| 144 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with 4 ARM64 cores and 24GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Provisioning compute resources with specific architectures and memory types is a standard NFV deployment task. | 4 | Specifies core count, architecture, memory, and a performance characteristic ("high-performance"). | 5 | The language is clear, direct, and easy to parse. | 5 | "Provision...compute resources" is a clear expression of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The specified resources and the target goal ("demanding network functions") are logically connected. | 5 | The resource allocation (4 cores, 24GB RAM) is a very common and consistent size for a virtualized network function. | 4 | The intent is slightly incomplete as it doesn't name the specific network function(s) to be deployed on these resources. | 4.7 | A strong, clear intent for resource provisioning, which is a key part of the deployment process. |
| 145 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 4minutes/14minutes/37minutes multi-tier escalation through REST_API notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | Multi-tier escalation and specific notification channels (REST API) are standard concepts in modern monitoring systems. "Intelligent routing" is a valid concept, though abstract here. | 4 | Specifies a complex escalation timeline, the notification channel, and a routing method with priority. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and uses standard terminology (REST_API, multi-tier escalation). | 4 | While it sets up a notification *system*, it doesn't specify the trigger conditions for the notifications themselves, making it slightly misaligned. It's more of a configuration intent. | 5 | The components (escalation timeline, channel, routing) are logically connected to define a notification delivery policy. | 5 | The parameters are consistent for setting up a robust, tiered alerting mechanism for critical systems. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it defines the "how" of notifications (escalation, channel) but not the "what" or "when" (the actual trigger conditions). | 4.3 | A good intent for configuring a notification mechanism, but it's incomplete as a standalone notification request because it lacks trigger conditions. |
| 146 | Deployment Intent | Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 325.59ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics. | 4 | GBR and PDB are correct 3GPP terms. However, a 325ms PDB is extremely high for something labeled "mission-critical" and "deterministic," which usually implies low latency. | 4 | It specifies priority, GBR, PDB, and application type with multiple "mission-critical" qualifiers. | 4 | The intent is readable but the repetitive use of "mission-critical" is stylistically poor and adds little value. | 5 | "Launch...network service" directly corresponds to a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The intent coherently defines a service with a specific set of QoS parameters. | 2 | A PDB of 325.59ms is far too high to be consistent with a "mission-critical" service requiring "deterministic performance." This is a major contradiction. | 4 | Specifies key QoS parameters, but is missing a service or slice identifier (S-NSSAI) for targeting. | 4.0 | A clear deployment intent whose credibility is severely damaged by a completely inconsistent PDB value for a "mission-critical" service. |
| 147 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps throughput deterministic performance drops below thresholds or 5ms ultra-low latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-3347-1277] | 5 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. Adding qualifiers like "deterministic" and "ultra-low" specifies a stricter monitoring context, which is valid and aligned with URLLC concepts. | 4 | The intent is similar to a standard performance alert but adds qualifiers ("deterministic," "ultra-low") that increase its specificity. | 5 | The trigger conditions and the requested action are stated clearly and unambiguously. | 5 | This is a classic example of a "Regular Notification Request," asking for an alert based on specific performance events. | 5 | The structure is logical: a set of conditions (performance degradation) triggers a specific action (alert and escalate). | 5 | The performance targets (1Gbps, 5ms) and qualifiers are consistent with a high-performance, latency-sensitive service (e.g., URLLC). | 4 | The intent is clear but uses generic terms like "thresholds" and "acceptable limits" instead of specific values, making it slightly less complete. | 4.7 | A very clear and well-formed intent for monitoring a high-performance, latency-sensitive service. |
| 148 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 45 RISC_V processing cores at 3.31GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (RISC-V), and clock speed are appropriate parameters for such a check. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed). | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study, especially with the growing interest in RISC-V for specific workloads. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of deploying an NF on an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 149 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 2minutes/13minutes/27minutes multi-tier escalation through gRPC notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | Multi-tier escalation and specific notification channels (gRPC) are standard concepts in modern monitoring systems. "Intelligent routing" is a valid concept, though abstract here. | 4 | Specifies a complex escalation timeline, the notification channel, and a routing method with priority. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and uses standard terminology (gRPC, multi-tier escalation). | 4 | While it sets up a notification *system*, it doesn't specify the trigger conditions for the notifications themselves, making it slightly misaligned. It's more of a configuration intent. | 5 | The components (escalation timeline, channel, routing) are logically connected to define a notification delivery policy. | 5 | The parameters are consistent for setting up a robust, tiered alerting mechanism for critical systems. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it defines the "how" of notifications (escalation, channel) but not the "what" or "when" (the actual trigger conditions). | 4.3 | A good intent for configuring a notification mechanism, but it's incomplete as a standalone notification request because it lacks trigger conditions. |
| 150 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with 3hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method.

| 155 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with high-priority 10hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary 5G authentication method. 128-NEA3 (128-bit ZUC) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm. The sentence structure, however, remains confusing. | 3 | Specifies two alert triggers and a notification topic, but the phrasing is ambiguous about their relationship. | 3 | The sentence mixes reactive alerts (failures) with a separate notification topic (key rotation), making it structurally confusing. | 5 | The core request to be alerted about security events aligns with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak as it joins two different notification types without a clear logical connection. | 5 | The technical parameters (5G-AKA, 128-NEA3) are individually correct and consistent with 3GPP standards. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the link between the security breaches and the key rotation notification is undefined. | 3.9 | A technically correct but poorly structured intent that suffers from a lack of coherence and completeness in its description. |
| 156 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 14hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-3356-1352] | 4 | EAP-TLS is valid. `128_NEA2` is a contradiction: NEA2 uses a 256-bit key, not 128-bit. This is a technical error.

AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (ARM64), clock speed, and performance type are valid parameters. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF) and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) along with performance constraints. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study of a very high-performance NF. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of a network function deployment. |
| 180 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 247724_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and EAP_AKA_Prime/128_NEA1 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 5 | Device density and security overhead are valid feasibility considerations. EAP-AKA' and 128-NEA1 (128-bit AES) are correct and standard 5G security mechanisms. | 4 | The intent is complex, asking to analyze the impact of two different factors (device density and security overhead) on the system. | 5 | The request is clear, technically correct, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Consider" (in the context of impact) aligns well with the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to check the impact of both device density and security overhead is a coherent part of a system-level feasibility study. | 5 | The specified device density and security mechanisms are consistent and represent a valid scenario for analysis. | 4 | The intent is slightly incomplete as it doesn't specify which "system" or NF is being evaluated. | 4.7 | A very good, complex feasibility check that accurately specifies relevant parameters for a system performance analysis. |
| 181 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 29 RISC_V processing cores at 3.7GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (RISC-V), and clock speed are appropriate parameters for such a check. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed). | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study on a high-performance emerging hardware architecture. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of deploying an NF on an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 182 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with high-priority 19hours automated key management. | 4 | 5G-AKA is correct. However, `256_NEA1` is non-standard and likely an error for NEA2 (256-bit AES) as NEA1 is 128-bit. | 4 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters: authentication method, encryption algorithm, and a key rotation policy with priority. | 5 | Despite the technical error, the intent is phrased clearly and is easy to read. | 5 | Securing the network is a core part of performance assurance. | 4 | The components form a coherent security policy structure, but the technical error slightly detracts from logical correctness. | 3 | The specification `256_NEA1` is inconsistent with 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent defines most of a security policy but is flawed by the incorrect encryption parameter. It also lacks scope. | 4.1 | A well-structured intent that is critically flawed by an incorrect and contradictory technical parameter for encryption. |
| 183 | Deployment Intent | Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 3413Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 18.3ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms. | 5 | eMBB is a standard slice type. Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. Traffic engineering and QoS are the standard mechanisms for achieving such performance. | 5 | This is a complex intent specifying the slice type (eMBB), performance targets (throughput, latency), and implementation methods. | 4 | The term "high-high-throughput" is a typo/redundancy. The rest of the intent is clear and readable. | 4 | The action is "Optimize," which suggests modifying an existing slice. If the slice does not exist, it's a deployment. The phrasing is slightly ambiguous. | 5 | The intent coherently links the slice type with appropriate performance goals and the mechanisms to achieve them. | 5 | The targets (high throughput, medium latency) are fully consistent with the goals of an eMBB slice. | 5 | The intent provides a complete set of goals and methods for a slice performance optimization task. | 4.7 | An excellent, technically rich intent for an eMBB slice, slightly marred by a typo and minor ambiguity in the primary action (Optimize vs. Deploy). |
| 184 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 49 RISC_V processing cores at 3.4GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (RISC-V), and clock speed are appropriate parameters for such a check. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed). | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study on a high-performance emerging hardware architecture. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of deploying an NF on an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 185 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 65 RISC_V processing cores at 3.61GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (RISC-V), clock speed, and priority are appropriate parameters. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), priority, and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed). | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study on a high-performance emerging hardware architecture. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of deploying an NF on an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 186 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 46 core utilization and 272GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This aligns with 3GPP management functions. The addition of "deterministic performance" suggests a focus on latency variation (jitter), which is a valid advanced analysis type. | 4 | Specifies the target (AMF), metrics, analysis type ("deterministic"), and output. | 5 | The request is clear and well-structured. | 5 | The request to "Generate a report" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | All elements of the request are logically connected to form a single, coherent task. | 5 | The resource configuration is consistent with a workload where deterministic performance is a major concern. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information for an analytics function to execute the request. | 4.9 | An excellent, advanced reporting intent that correctly specifies a more nuanced type of performance analysis. |
| 187 | Modification Intent | Update QoS flow 5QI_6_Video_TCP configuration with 3704Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality. | 4 | 5QI 6 is a standard GBR flow for Video (buffered, TCP-based). However, a max bitrate of nearly 4Gbps for a single QoS flow is extremely high and likely unrealistic for this 5QI, which is not designed for such high peak rates. | 4 | The intent is specific, targeting a particular 5QI and specifying a maximum bitrate. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and easy to parse. | 5 | The action "Update...configuration" is a clear match for a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The structure is coherent: it identifies a QoS flow and specifies a parameter to modify. | 2 | The specified bitrate (3704 Mbps) is inconsistent with the typical use case for 5QI 6. While for a GBR flow, this is a maximum, it's an unusually high value that may not be supported or practical for this flow type. | 4 | The intent is actionable but based on a questionable parameter value. It's also missing context on which PDU sessions or UEs this applies to. | 4.1 | A structurally sound intent that is weakened by a likely unrealistic and inconsistent bitrate value for the specified 5QI. |
| 188 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 108GB HBM2 memory and 1008GB SATA_SSD storage with mission-critical deterministic performance impact analysis. | 5 | This aligns with pre-deployment checks. HBM2 is high-performance memory, and SATA SSD is standard storage. | 4 | The intent is specific, naming advanced memory (HBM2) and requesting a "mission-critical deterministic" analysis. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, using precise technical terms. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" directly corresponds to the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to evaluate specific hardware requirements and analyze the performance impact is a logical sequence. | 3 | There is an inconsistency. HBM2 is extremely high-performance memory. Pairing it with a much slower SATA SSD (instead of NVMe) for a "mission-critical deterministic performance" workload is a poor and inconsistent architectural choice. | 4 | The check is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the application or network function it is for. | 4.4 | A strong feasibility check that is undermined by an inconsistent and illogical combination of hardware components for its stated performance goal. |
| 189 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 67 processing cores and 363GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying compute resources is standard. However, "transport network optimization" is vague and its connection to the compute resource change is unclear. | 4 | The intent combines a specific, quantitative change (cores, memory) with a very broad, qualitative goal that has been given a high priority. | 4 | The first clause is very clear, but the second ("with...transport network optimization") is ambiguous and lacks actionable detail. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify...processing cores and memory," aligns perfectly with "Modification Intent". | 3 | The coherence is weak as there is no clear logical link provided between modifying a core NF's compute resources and optimizing the transport network. | 4 | While thematically related to network improvement, the two clauses address different domains (compute vs. transport) without a clear bridge, affecting consistency. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is not a specific, actionable instruction, even with a "mission-critical" tag. | 3.9 | A clear resource modification intent that is significantly weakened by the inclusion of a vague and poorly connected secondary goal. |
| 190 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization with high-priority genetic algorithms for complex deterministic performance trade-off management. | 5 | Multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithms is a standard and advanced technique. Focusing on "deterministic performance" is a valid, specific goal. | 4 | The intent specifies a particular, advanced optimization technique for a complex problem (deterministic performance trade-offs). | 3 | The phrasing is very repetitive ("multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization", "genetic algorithms"). It's readable but could be much more concise. | 5 | The goal to "Implement...optimization...for...performance trade-off management" is a core "Performance Assurance" task. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the application of a specific algorithm to a specific problem domain. | 5 | The use of a genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization of deterministic performance is a consistent and valid approach. | 5 | The intent is complete enough to specify the desired optimization methodology. | 4.6 | A strong, technically advanced intent that is slightly weakened by repetitive and verbose phrasing. |
| 191 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 56 RISC_V processing cores at 2.14GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (RISC-V), and clock speed are appropriate parameters for such a check. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF), and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed). | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and performance constraints is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study on an emerging hardware architecture. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of deploying an NF on an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 192 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 69GB DDR5 memory and 4527GB NVMe_SSD storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 5 | This aligns with pre-deployment checks. DDR5 and NVMe SSD are standard hardware specifications. | 3 | The intent is straightforward, asking to evaluate two resource parameters and their performance impact with a priority. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" directly maps to the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to evaluate resource requirements and then analyze the performance impact is a logical sequence. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a standard hardware configuration for a server. | 4 | The check is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the application or network function it is for. | 4.6 | A clear and practical feasibility check, useful for resource planning before a deployment. |
| 193 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 80 processing cores and 100GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | This is a standard resource management intent, fully aligned with ETSI ZSM/NFV concepts. | 4 | Specifies multiple resource dimensions, a constraint, and high-level goals. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easily parsable. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and precise description of a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The components (resource adjustment, constraints, goals) are logically connected into a coherent instruction. | 5 | The parameters are internally consistent and represent a valid resource modification request for a large network function. | 4 | The intent is specific about the resource changes but lacks the target entity (e.g., a specific NF or service) to be fully complete. | 4.7 | A clear and actionable intent for resource modification, slightly missing the target context for full completeness. |
| 194 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous performance optimization using lstm_with high-priority_attention_mechanism machine learning models with high-priority 95.29% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 5 | This aligns perfectly with the goals of NWDAF and closed-loop automation, using specific ML models (LSTM with attention) to achieve a performance goal (accuracy). | 5 | This is a highly complex intent specifying the optimization goal, the ML model to use, and a specific performance target for the model itself. | 4 | The use of "high-priority" inside the model name is unconventional and harms readability/parsability. It should be a separate parameter. | 5 | The goal is to "Implement...performance optimization," which is a core "Performance Assurance" task. | 5 | The intent coherently links the goal (optimization) with the tool (ML model) and a quality metric for that tool (accuracy). | 5 | Using an LSTM model to achieve a high prediction accuracy for network management is a consistent and modern approach. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing a clear goal, methodology, and a measurable success criterion. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically sophisticated intent that is only slightly flawed by the non-standard placement of a priority qualifier within an object name. |
| 195 | Deployment Intent | Deploy cloud-native ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications services using Istio service mesh architecture, enabling microservices communication and production-ready comprehensive traffic management capabilities. | 5 | URLLC is a 5G service type. Istio is a standard service mesh for cloud-native applications. Combining them for a microservices-based URLLC deployment is a valid, advanced architectural approach. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the service type (URLLC), the underlying architecture (cloud-native with Istio), and the capabilities this enables. | 3 | The term "ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency" is a typo/exaggeration. Standard term is URLLC. This harms readability. | 5 | The verb "Deploy" and the description of the service to be created are a clear match for a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | The intent coherently connects the desired service (URLLC) with a suitable implementation technology (Istio service mesh). | 5 | Using a service mesh like Istio to manage traffic for URLLC microservices is a consistent and modern cloud-native design pattern. | 5 | The intent is complete, describing the what (URLLC service) and the how (Istio architecture) in sufficient detail. | 4.7 | A technically excellent and forward-looking intent that is only slightly marred by a typo in the service name. |
| 196 | Modification Intent | Update artificial intelligence models to lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism achieving 89.76% prediction accuracy with mission-critical multi_objective_genetic_algorithm optimization algorithms, enhancing intelligent network operations. | 5 | The specified ML models (LSTM with attention) and optimization algorithms (genetic algorithm) are standard techniques in advanced network analytics (e.g., NWDAF). | 5 | This is a highly complex intent specifying the new ML model, a target performance metric (accuracy), and the optimization algorithm to be used, with priorities. | 4 | The use of "mission-critical" inside the model and algorithm names is unconventional and harms readability/parsability. It should be a separate parameter. | 5 | The verb "Update" clearly indicates a modification to an existing system, making it a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The components (new model, performance goal, optimization method) are all logically connected parts of an AI model update process. | 5 | It's consistent to use a genetic algorithm to optimize a neural network model like an LSTM to achieve a target accuracy. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the 'what' (model), the 'why' (accuracy target), and the 'how' (optimization algorithm). | 4.9 | A technically excellent and complete intent that is slightly flawed by the non-standard placement of priority qualifiers within object names. |
| 197 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 65 x86_64 processing cores at 2.69GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a standard pre-deployment check. AMF is a 5G NF, and specifying core count, architecture (x86_64), and clock speed are valid parameters for such an assessment. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF (AMF) and provides detailed CPU parameters (core count, architecture, clock speed) to be considered in the check. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The verb "Assess...feasibility" is a direct match for the purpose of an "Intent Feasibility Check". | 5 | The request to assess deployment feasibility based on specific hardware and general requirements is a logical and coherent process. | 5 | The parameters are consistent and represent a realistic scenario for a feasibility study of a standard NF deployment. | 5 | The intent is complete enough for a planning or simulation tool to execute the feasibility check. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and specific intent for checking the feasibility of a network function deployment. |
| 198 | Deployment Intent | Optimize cloud-native performance achieving 4784Mbps high-throughput targets and 39.0ms latency requirements through intelligent resource allocation and traffic optimization. | 4 | While performance optimization is a goal, this sounds more like a Performance Assurance or Modification intent rather than a new deployment. The action is "Optimize," not "Deploy." | 5 | This is a complex intent specifying multiple performance targets (throughput, latency) and the methods to achieve them (resource allocation, traffic optimization). | 5 | The intent is very clear, with specific, quantifiable performance targets. | 3 | The intent describes optimizing an existing system's performance ("achieving...targets") rather than deploying a new one. This is a mismatch with the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking the high-level goal (optimize performance) with specific targets and methods. | 5 | The targets (high throughput, medium latency) are consistent with an eMBB-type service, and the methods are appropriate. | 5 | The intent provides a complete set of goals and methods for a performance optimization task. | 4.6 | A very well-defined and clear intent for performance optimization, but it is misclassified as a Deployment Intent. |
| 199 | Deployment Intent | Deploy enterprise-grade AMF network function using Samsung SW_1.8.269 software on high-performance 2-core x86_64 architecture with high-priority 13GB DDR5 memory and 97GB SATA_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G Core NF. Specifying vendor, SW version, architecture, memory, and storage are all standard parameters in NFV deployments. | 5 | This is a highly detailed intent specifying the NF, vendor, SW version, hardware architecture, and specific resource allocations with priority. | 5 | The intent is structured as a clear command with all necessary parameters, ideal for automation. | 5 | The description to "Deploy" a specific network function is a textbook example of a "Deployment Intent". | 5 | All the specified parameters logically contribute to a single, coherent instruction for deploying a network function. | 5 | The specified resources are consistent and plausible for a small-scale but modern network function instance. | 5 | This intent provides a rich set of details, making it very complete and directly actionable by an orchestrator. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a detailed, actionable, and standards-aligned deployment intent. |
| 200 | Deployment Intent | Secure multi-domain orchestration using HMAC_SHA256 key derivation functions with high-priority 128_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 15hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle. | 5 | HMAC-SHA256 is a standard cryptographic function. Key rotation policies are a fundamental security best practice. This aligns with secure orchestration principles. | 5 | This is a complex security policy intent, specifying the algorithm, key size, rotation schedule, and priority for multi-domain orchestration. | 5 | The intent is technically specific but clearly written and easy to understand. | 4 | This describes the configuration of a security mechanism *for* orchestration, rather than the deployment of a network service itself. It's more of a security configuration intent. | 5 | The components (algorithm, key size, rotation) form a complete and coherent security policy. | 5 | All the specified security parameters are consistent with modern cryptographic best practices. A 128-bit key for HMAC-SHA256 is acceptable, though 256-bit is more common. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary parameters to configure the security mechanism. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically detailed intent for configuring a security policy, although its classification as a "Deployment Intent" is borderline. |
