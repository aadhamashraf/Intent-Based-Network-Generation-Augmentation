| 1 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 87 processing cores and 157GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | The intent uses generic terms like "core network." While valid, it lacks specificity regarding which 3GPP Network Function (e.g., AMF, SMF) is being modified. | 3 | The intent specifies exact CPU and memory values but the "transport network optimization" aspect is high-level and lacks specific parameters. | 5 | The description is clear, grammatically correct, and easy for an engineer to understand. | 5 | The description clearly outlines a modification to network resources, perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical, linking resource modification with an optimization goal. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions; the specified actions are consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "transport network optimization" is too vague to be directly actionable without further clarification. | 4.3 | A clear, readable intent that is slightly generic and lacks specific details on the optimization goal. |
| 2 | Deployment Intent | "Orchestrate comprehensive PCF deployment through coordinated nfvo_46719c3f8195 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_8c24fd6fa522 VNF Manager interaction, ensuring seamless lifecycle management and resource optimization." | 5 | The intent correctly references the PCF (a 3GPP 5G NF) and the ETSI MANO architecture (NFVO, VNFM) for orchestration, which is standard practice. | 4 | The intent describes a multi-component orchestration process, indicating a good level of technical complexity beyond a simple deployment. | 5 | The language is professional, clear, and uses standard acronyms appropriately, making it easy to parse. | 5 | The description is entirely focused on the deployment of a PCF, directly aligning with the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The request flows logically from the action (orchestrate deployment) to the means (NFVO/VNFM) and the goal (lifecycle management). | 5 | All components mentioned (PCF, NFVO, VNFM) work together in a standard deployment workflow. | 4 | While it specifies the orchestration mechanism, it lacks details about the PCF's specific configuration or resource requirements. | 4.7 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that accurately describes a network function deployment process using established orchestration frameworks. |
| 3 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 361Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with mission-critical 15.43ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 4 | The use of bitrate and latency as constraints is standard. While 15.43ms is a valid latency target, calling it "ultra-low latency" is a slight stretch, as URLLC typically targets much lower values (~1ms). | 3 | The intent specifies key performance indicators (KPIs) but remains at a high level of abstraction, suitable for an initial feasibility check. | 5 | The request is concise, clear, and unambiguous. | 5 | The description directly asks for a "feasibility" analysis of specific parameters, perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The sentence logically connects the analysis goal with the constraints and context. | 5 | The specified bitrate and latency values are not contradictory and represent a valid performance target. | 4 | The intent provides the core constraints for the analysis but does not specify the target service or slice type, which would add more context. | 4.4 | A clear and well-formed feasibility request, although the term "ultra-low latency" could be more precise for the given value. |
| 4 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant Isolation_Forest anomaly detection with mission-critical 16% data sampling over 54days retention period. | 3 | While analytics are key to modern networks (e.g., 3GPP NWDAF), "Isolation_Forest" is a specific ML technique, not a 3GPP standard. The intent doesn't link to a standard network function. | 4 | The intent shows complexity by specifying an ML model, data sampling rate, and retention period, indicating a detailed analytics task. | 5 | The language is precise and clear, making the request understandable for a data analytics team. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "compile intelligent analytics insights," which is a perfect match for an "Intent Report Request." | 5 | The request is well-structured, detailing the method, data handling, and timeframe for the report. | 5 | All parameters (ML model, sampling, retention) are consistent and relevant to an analytics task. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete for a report request but could be improved by specifying the data source or target metrics for anomaly detection. | 4.4 | A technically specific and clear report request, though it relies on non-standardized ML models rather than 3GPP-defined analytics functions. |
| 5 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 7 processing cores and 505GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Similar to record 1, the intent uses the generic term "core network" without specifying a 3GPP NF, making it slightly less aligned with standards. | 3 | Specifies exact resource values but the optimization goal is vague, making the overall complexity moderate. | 5 | The sentence is simple, clear, and easy to understand. | 5 | The description directly states a modification of resources, aligning perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links the resource modification to a broader optimization goal. | 5 | The request to modify CPU and memory is straightforward and contains no contradictions. | 3 | The term "transport network optimization" is not specific enough to be fully actionable without more context. | 4.3 | A straightforward and readable resource modification intent that could benefit from more specific optimization parameters. |
| 6 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 73 core utilization and 280GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly references the AMF, a key 5G core network function, and focuses on standard performance metrics (CPU/memory), aligning with 3GPP operational principles. | 4 | The request is specific, targeting a particular NF (AMF), its metrics, and the expected output (recommendations), showing good technical depth. | 5 | The request is well-phrased, unambiguous, and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The description's purpose is to "Generate a comprehensive... report," which is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The sentence logically outlines the subject (AMF), the analysis points (cores, memory), and the desired outcome (recommendations). | 5 | All parts of the request are consistent and contribute to the goal of generating a performance report. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary information for an analytics system to generate the requested report. | 4.9 | An excellent, highly specific, and actionable intent that is perfectly aligned with 3GPP standards and operational needs. |
| 7 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 3hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol. However, "256_NEA2" is incorrect. 3GPP TS 33.501 specifies NEA2 as a 128-bit AES algorithm. A 256-bit algorithm would be different. The combination of alerting on breaches with key rotation notifications is slightly disjointed. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple conditions (authentication failures, security breaches) and a related event (key rotation), making it moderately complex. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the link between the security alerts and the key rotation notification could be stated more explicitly. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events is a clear fit for a "Regular Notification Request." | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, but it combines two distinct alert triggers with a third notification event, which could be separate intents. | 3 | The "256_NEA2" terminology is inconsistent with 3GPP standards. The connection between auth failures and key rotation events is not direct. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the conditions for alerting, making it actionable. | 4.0 | A good notification intent that is slightly flawed by incorrect security algorithm terminology and a slightly disjointed structure. |
| 8 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-3608-2900] | 4 | The performance targets (1000Mbps, 5ms) are standard metrics. "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" is a plausible implementation detail but not a 3GPP-standardized mechanism. | 4 | The intent specifies concrete performance targets and a method for achieving them (scaling), showing good technical detail. | 5 | The sentence is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The goal to "Implement high-performance networking" is a core example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome (performance targets) with the means to achieve it (intelligent scaling). | 5 | The high-throughput and low-latency goals are complementary and consistent with a high-performance service. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying the service or network slice this performance applies to. | 4.6 | A very clear and well-defined performance intent with specific, measurable targets. |
| 9 | Deployment Intent | "Monitor security events using fault-tolerant Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with mission-critical 3minutes/7minutes/11minutes escalation policies, ensuring rapid response to security incidents." | 3 | Uses a non-standard ML model (Isolation_Forest). Security monitoring is a valid concept (related to 3GPP SECAM), but the implementation details are not standards-based. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a detection model and a multi-tiered escalation policy, which requires a sophisticated monitoring setup. | 5 | The description is clear and details a precise operational workflow. | 2 | This describes the configuration of a monitoring and alerting policy, which is more aligned with a "Security Intent" or "Modification Intent," not the deployment of a new network function or service. | 5 | The sentence flows logically from the monitoring method to the escalation policy and the overall goal. | 5 | Anomaly detection and escalation policies are consistent components of a security monitoring strategy. | 4 | The intent specifies the 'how' (algorithm) and 'what to do' (escalation) but not 'what to monitor', which is a missing detail. | 4.1 | A well-defined and complex security monitoring policy that is misclassified as a "Deployment Intent." |
| 10 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 27 RISC_V processing cores at 2.01GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly identifies a 3GPP NF (AMF) and relevant feasibility parameters (CPU architecture, cores, clock speed). RISC-V is a valid, emerging architecture for network workloads. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, mentioning not just core count but also architecture (RISC_V) and clock speed, adding significant complexity. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and technically precise. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Assess... feasibility," perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure logically links the target component (AMF) with the specific hardware constraints to be evaluated. | 5 | All parameters provided (AMF, RISC-V, cores, frequency) are consistent and relevant to a hardware feasibility check. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary details to perform the requested feasibility analysis for the specified hardware. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically detailed, and standards-aligned feasibility check that reflects modern hardware considerations. |
| 11 | Modification Intent | Adjust Massive_MIMO_32T32R radio parameters and Vertical_Beamforming beamforming configuration with high-priority core network coordination. | 5 | The terms "Massive_MIMO_32T32R" and "Vertical_Beamforming" are correct and relevant concepts for 5G NR (New Radio) as per 3GPP standards. | 5 | The intent combines multiple advanced radio concepts (MIMO antenna configuration, beamforming type) and coordination with the core network, making it highly complex. | 5 | The language is precise and would be clearly understood by a radio access network (RAN) engineer. | 5 | The request to "Adjust" radio parameters is a clear modification action. | 5 | The structure is logical, specifying the components to be modified and the necessary coordination. | 5 | All elements—MIMO, beamforming, and core network coordination—are interconnected and consistent in RAN optimization. | 4 | The intent is very specific but could be improved by detailing which "radio parameters" to adjust. | 4.9 | An outstanding, technically rich, and standards-aligned intent for RAN modification. |
| 12 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-deterministic performance infrastructure using 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 128_NEA1 encryption protocols without compromising deterministic performance characteristics. [Instance-3612-2923] | 4 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication framework for 5G. 128-NEA1 (SNOW 3G) is a valid, albeit older, encryption algorithm specified in TS 33.401. The focus on security's impact on performance is highly relevant. | 4 | The intent links security mechanisms (authentication, encryption) directly to performance goals ("deterministic performance"), which is a complex and important consideration. | 5 | The intent is well-written and clearly states the goal of achieving security without performance degradation. | 5 | This intent focuses on assuring performance under specific security constraints, which is a perfect fit for its type. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical, stating the goal, the methods, and the critical constraint. | 5 | The use of specific authentication and encryption methods is consistent with securing a network infrastructure. | 4 | The intent is clear but "high-deterministic performance" could be quantified with specific latency/jitter metrics. | 4.6 | A strong intent that correctly links security and performance assurance, using appropriate (though slightly dated) 3GPP terminology. |
| 13 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 5 core utilization and 25GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. [Instance-3613-2941] | 5 | Correctly references the AMF, a 5G core NF, and standard performance metrics (CPU/memory), aligning perfectly with operational standards. | 4 | The request is specific, targeting a particular NF, its metrics, and the desired output (recommendations). | 5 | The request is well-phrased, unambiguous, and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The description's purpose is to "Generate a comprehensive... report," a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The sentence logically outlines the subject (AMF), the analysis points, and the desired outcome. | 5 | All parts of the request are consistent and contribute to the goal of generating a performance report. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary information for an analytics system to generate the requested report. | 4.9 | An excellent, highly specific, and actionable intent that is perfectly aligned with 3GPP standards and operational needs. |
| 14 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 60 x86_64 processing cores at 2.89GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly identifies a 3GPP NF (AMF) and relevant feasibility parameters (CPU architecture, cores, clock speed), all of which are standard for infrastructure planning. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, detailing core count, architecture (x86_64), and clock speed for the feasibility assessment. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and technically precise. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Assess... feasibility," perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure logically links the target component (AMF) with the specific hardware constraints to be evaluated. | 5 | All parameters provided (AMF, x86_64, cores, frequency) are consistent and relevant to a hardware feasibility check. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary details to perform the requested feasibility analysis for the specified hardware. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically detailed, and standards-aligned feasibility check. |
| 15 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications monitoring with One_Class_SVM behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for deterministic performance degradation. [Instance-3615-2958] | 3 | "ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency" is redundant and non-standard; the 3GPP term is URLLC. One-Class SVM is a generic ML model, not a 3GPP standard. The concepts are relevant to NWDAF, but the terminology is flawed. | 4 | The intent combines multiple concepts: a service type (URLLC), monitoring, a specific ML model, and an alerting condition, making it complex. | 3 | The redundant terminology ("ultra-ultra-reliable") makes the intent less professional and clear than it could be. | 5 | The intent's goal is to configure monitoring and alerting, which fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The sentence structure is a bit long but generally coherent, linking the service to the monitoring method and alert trigger. | 4 | The concepts are logically connected, but the terminology for URLLC is internally inconsistent (redundant). | 4 | The intent specifies the service type, detection method, and alert condition, making it fairly complete. | 3.9 | A conceptually sound but poorly phrased intent due to non-standard and redundant terminology. |
| 16 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 21 core utilization and 10GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF, a 5G core NF, and standard performance metrics (CPU/memory), aligning perfectly with operational standards. | 4 | The request is specific, targeting a particular NF, its metrics, and the desired output (recommendations). | 5 | The request is well-phrased, unambiguous, and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The description's purpose is to "Generate a comprehensive... report," a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The sentence logically outlines the subject (AMF), the analysis points, and the desired outcome. | 5 | All parts of the request are consistent and contribute to the goal of generating a performance report. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary information for an analytics system to generate the requested report. | 4.9 | An excellent, highly specific, and actionable intent that is perfectly aligned with 3GPP standards and operational needs. |
| 17 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 18GB DDR5 memory and 7012GB Optane storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | The intent specifies valid hardware components (DDR5, Optane) and a relevant goal (performance impact analysis). However, it fails to mention the network function or service being evaluated, which is a key piece of context. | 3 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying exact memory/storage types and requiring a performance impact analysis. | 5 | The language is clear and technically precise. | 5 | The description asks to "Evaluate memory and storage requirements," which is a type of feasibility check. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical and clear. | 5 | The specified hardware components are consistent with a high-performance computing evaluation. | 2 | The intent is critically incomplete as it does not specify which application, network function, or service the hardware is intended for. | 4.1 | A technically precise but incomplete feasibility check, as it omits the workload to be evaluated. |
| 18 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication protocol. However, "256_NEA2" is incorrect as NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm. The link between auth failures and key rotation notifications is indirect. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple alert triggers and a related notification, showing moderate complexity. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between the alerts and the separate notification event could be better defined. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The structure is a bit disjointed, combining two alert types with a third, separate notification topic. | 3 | The "256_NEA2" terminology contradicts 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the conditions for alerting. | 3.9 | A decent notification intent that is marred by incorrect security algorithm terminology. |
| 19 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 1hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. However, "256_NEA1" is incorrect; NEA1 (SNOW 3G) is a 128-bit algorithm. This is a recurring error pattern. | 4 | Specifies multiple alert triggers and a related notification, making it moderately complex. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but again, it loosely combines security alerts with a key rotation notification. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The sentence structure is acceptable but combines multiple, not directly related, notification events. | 3 | The "256_NEA1" terminology is inconsistent with 3GPP specifications. | 4 | The conditions for alerting are clearly specified, making the intent actionable. | 3.9 | Another notification intent with the same flaw of incorrect security algorithm naming. |
| 20 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 81 processing cores and 249GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | The intent describes modifying standard compute resources. "Execution timeout" is a common parameter but not specifically defined in 3GPP NF configuration standards. | 4 | Specifies multiple parameters (cores, memory, timeout) and links them to dual optimization goals (performance, cost), showing good complexity. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and clearly communicates the required changes and goals. | 5 | The request to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear example of a modification intent. | 5 | The intent flows logically from the specific changes to the desired outcomes. | 5 | The parameters are consistent with a resource modification task aimed at performance and cost optimization. | 4 | The intent is quite complete but does not specify which network function or service these resources are for. | 4.6 | A well-written, complex intent for resource modification that could be improved by naming the target function. |
| 21 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade UPF network function using Ericsson SW_1.6.382 software on high-performance 3-core ARM64 architecture with 8GB DDR4 memory and 356GB SATA_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | The intent correctly identifies a 3GPP NF (UPF), a vendor, software version, and specific, valid hardware details (ARM64, DDR4, SATA_SSD), which is perfectly aligned with real-world deployment scenarios. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, providing a full deployment profile including software, vendor, and a detailed hardware specification. | 5 | The description is exceptionally clear, precise, and contains all the necessary information for a deployment task. | 5 | The intent to "Deploy... UPF network function" is a perfect match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The structure is flawless, detailing the what, how, and on what for the deployment. | 5 | All specified components (UPF, Ericsson SW, ARM64, DDR4) are consistent and plausible for a network function deployment. | 5 | This intent is fully complete, providing a comprehensive set of parameters for deployment. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a deployment intent. It is specific, complete, standards-aligned, and reflects a real-world scenario. |
| 22 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Massive_MIMO_64T64R antenna systems with mission-critical 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 65Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | All technical terms used (Massive MIMO 64T64R, 3D Beamforming) are correct and advanced 5G NR concepts defined in 3GPP standards. Backhaul capacity is a critical related parameter. | 5 | The intent combines multiple, interconnected, and advanced RAN technologies (MIMO, beamforming, backhaul), indicating high complexity. | 5 | The language is technically precise and would be perfectly clear to a RAN engineer. | 5 | The request to "Reconfigure" antenna systems is a clear modification action. | 5 | The sentence structure logically connects the components to be modified with the overall performance goals. | 5 | All the technical elements are consistent and work together to achieve the stated goals of improved coverage and performance. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the technologies to be reconfigured and the target backhaul capacity. | 5.0 | An outstanding, technically rich, and standards-aligned intent for RAN modification. A perfect score. |
| 23 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 128_NEA3 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-3623-2997] | 5 | 5G-AKA is the correct primary authentication framework for 5G. 128-NEA3 (ZUC) is a valid encryption algorithm specified in TS 33.401. This is a well-formed, standards-correct intent. | 4 | The intent links specific security mechanisms to a performance goal, which is a complex but critical operational consideration. | 5 | The intent is well-written and clearly states the goal of achieving security without performance degradation. | 5 | The intent focuses on assuring performance under specific security constraints, which perfectly fits its type. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical, stating the goal, the methods, and the critical constraint. | 5 | The specified authentication and encryption methods are consistent with securing a modern 5G network. | 4 | The intent is clear but "high-performance infrastructure" could be quantified with specific metrics. | 4.7 | A strong, standards-aligned intent that correctly links security and performance assurance using appropriate 3GPP terminology. |
| 24 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with high-priority automated escalation. [Instance-3624-3011] | 5 | The intent refers to standard performance metrics (throughput, latency) that are key performance indicators (KPIs) in 3GPP networks. | 3 | The intent describes a standard threshold-based alerting mechanism, which is common but not overly complex. | 5 | The language is very clear, precise, and easily translatable into a monitoring system rule. | 5 | The request to "Alert when" certain conditions are met is the definition of a notification request. | 5 | The sentence logically defines the trigger conditions (performance drops) and the resulting action (escalation). | 5 | The throughput and latency metrics are consistent and often monitored together for a single service. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the metrics, their thresholds (implicitly), and the action to be taken. | 4.7 | A perfect example of a clear, actionable, and standards-relevant performance-based notification request. |
| 25 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 195ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | "Response time" is a valid performance metric. "Predictive analytics" and "automated remediation" are concepts aligned with zero-touch network management principles, relevant to 3GPP's management frameworks. | 4 | The intent combines a performance target with advanced operational methods (prediction, automation), making it complex. | 5 | The request is concise and clear. | 5 | The intent to "Optimize performance" to a specific target is a core function of performance assurance. | 5 | The sentence logically connects the goal (response time) with the methods (analytics, remediation). | 5 | The specified methods and goal are consistent and represent a modern approach to network management. | 3 | The intent is missing the context of which service or application this 195ms response time applies to. | 4.4 | A strong, clear intent describing a modern, automated approach to performance management, but it lacks service context. |
| 26 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 435GB DDR4 memory and 730GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | Specifies valid hardware components (DDR4, NVMe SSD) and a relevant goal. However, like record 17, it fails to mention the network function or workload to be evaluated. | 3 | The intent specifies exact memory/storage types and requires a performance impact analysis. | 5 | The language is clear and technically precise. | 5 | The description asks to "Evaluate memory and storage requirements," which is a type of feasibility check. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical and clear. | 5 | The specified hardware components are consistent with a high-performance computing evaluation. | 2 | The intent is critically incomplete as it does not specify which application or network function the hardware is intended for. | 4.1 | A technically precise but incomplete feasibility check due to the omission of the target workload. |
| 27 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-3627-3043] | 4 | The performance targets are standard KPIs. "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" is a plausible implementation method but not a standardized 3GPP mechanism. | 4 | The intent specifies concrete performance targets and a method for achieving them, showing good technical detail. | 5 | The sentence is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The goal to "Implement high-performance networking" is a core example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome with the means to achieve it. | 5 | The high-throughput and low-latency goals are complementary and consistent with a high-performance service. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying the service or network slice this performance applies to. | 4.6 | A very clear and well-defined performance intent with specific, measurable targets; a duplicate of record 8. |
| 28 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 122 processing cores and 277GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | The intent uses the generic term "core network" without specifying a 3GPP NF, making it slightly less aligned with standards. | 3 | Specifies exact resource values but the optimization goal is vague, making the overall complexity moderate. | 5 | The sentence is simple, clear, and easy to understand. | 5 | The description directly states a modification of resources, aligning perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links the resource modification to a broader optimization goal. | 5 | The request to modify CPU and memory is straightforward and contains no contradictions. | 3 | The term "transport network optimization" is not specific enough to be fully actionable. | 4.3 | A straightforward and readable resource modification intent that could benefit from more specific optimization parameters. |
| 29 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 22hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | 5G-AKA is correct. However, "256_NEA1" is incorrect as NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm. The disjointed combination of alerts and notifications persists. | 4 | Specifies multiple alert triggers and a related notification, showing moderate complexity. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between the alerts and the separate notification event could be better defined. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The structure is a bit disjointed, combining two alert types with a third, separate notification topic. | 3 | The "256_NEA1" terminology contradicts 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the conditions for alerting. | 3.9 | Another notification intent that is flawed by the same incorrect security algorithm terminology. |

AMF network function" is a perfect match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The structure is flawless, detailing the what, how, and on what for the deployment. | 5 | All specified components (AMF, ZTE SW, x86_64, DDR4, NVMe) are consistent and plausible for an NF deployment. | 5 | This intent is fully complete, providing a comprehensive set of parameters for deployment. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a deployment intent.

[Instance-3635-3093] | 3 | 5G-AKA is correct. However, "256_NEA2" is incorrect as NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm. The combination of alerts with a separate notification is slightly disjointed. | 4 | Specifies multiple alert triggers and a related notification, showing moderate complexity. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between the alerts and the key rotation notification could be better defined. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The structure combines two alert types with a third, separate notification topic, which is slightly convoluted. | 3 | The "256_NEA2" terminology contradicts 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the conditions for alerting. | 3.9 | A good notification intent that is again flawed by the same incorrect security algorithm terminology. |
| 36 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 78 processing cores and 271GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | The intent describes modifying standard compute resources. "Execution timeout" is a common parameter but not specifically defined in 3GPP NF standards. | 4 | Specifies multiple parameters (cores, memory, timeout) and links them to dual optimization goals (performance, cost), showing good complexity. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and clearly communicates the required changes and goals. | 5 | The request to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear example of a modification intent. | 5 | The intent flows logically from the specific changes to the desired outcomes. | 5 | The parameters are consistent with a resource modification task. | 4 | The intent is quite complete but does not specify which network function or service these resources are for. | 4.6 | A well-written, complex intent for resource modification that could be improved by naming the target function. |

| 38 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy sophisticated HMAC_SHA512 key derivation functions utilizing 256_bit cryptographic keys with automated 10hours rotation intervals, ensuring continuous security posture and cryptographic freshness." | 4 | HMAC-SHA512 is a standard cryptographic function, but 3GPP TS 33.501 specifies other KDFs (e.g., based on HMAC-SHA256) for key derivation. Using 256-bit keys with SHA512 is valid but maybe not optimal. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the KDF, key size, and a rotation policy, which details a robust security mechanism. | 5 | The language is technically precise and clearly describes the security configuration to be deployed. | 3 | This describes the deployment of a security policy or configuration, not a network function. It would be better classified as a "Security Intent" or "Modification Intent." | 5 | The sentence flows logically from the mechanism to its parameters and the security goal. | 4 | Using a 256-bit key for an HMAC-SHA512 function is unusual (as the output is 512 bits), but not strictly inconsistent. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary details to configure the specified key derivation and rotation policy. | 4.3 | A technically detailed security configuration intent that is slightly misaligned with 3GPP KDF specifications and is misclassified as a "Deployment Intent." |

| 44 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-TLS is correct. "256_NEA2" is incorrect as NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm. The combination of alerts with a separate notification is slightly disjointed. | 4 | Specifies multiple alert triggers and a related notification, showing moderate complexity. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between the alerts and the key rotation notification could be better defined. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The structure combines two alert types with a third, separate notification topic. | 3 | The "256_NEA2" terminology contradicts 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the conditions for alerting. | 3.9 | A good notification intent that is again flawed by the same incorrect security algorithm terminology. |

| 47 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-3647-3159] | 5 | The intent refers to standard performance metrics (throughput, latency) that are key performance indicators (KPIs) in 3GPP networks. | 3 | The intent describes a standard threshold-based alerting mechanism, which is common but not overly complex. | 5 | The language is very clear, precise, and easily translatable into a monitoring system rule. | 5 | The request to "Alert when" certain conditions are met is the definition of a notification request. | 5 | The sentence logically defines the trigger conditions and the resulting action. | 5 | The throughput and latency metrics are consistent and often monitored together for a single service. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the metrics, their thresholds (implicitly), and the action to be taken. | 4.7 | A perfect example of a clear, actionable, and standards-relevant performance-based notification request. |

| 52 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 2minutes/14minutes/51minutes multi-tier escalation through gRPC notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | gRPC is a standard technology for communication, and multi-tier escalation is a standard operational concept. It is not 3GPP-specific but highly relevant. | 3 | The intent specifies an escalation timeline and a notification protocol (gRPC), which is moderately complex. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and actionable for an operations team. | 3 | This is more of a configuration or modification intent to "implement" a policy. A "notification request" would typically be the *result* of this policy, not the setup of it. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical and clear. | 5 | All components (escalation times, gRPC, routing) are consistent with setting up a notification system. | 4 | The intent is missing the trigger condition for the escalation. What event starts the 2-minute timer? | 4.1 | A clear and practical intent for setting up an escalation policy, but it's slightly miscategorized and lacks a trigger condition. |

| 55 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous performance optimization using fault-tolerant lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism machine learning models with mission-critical 93.04% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 3 | LSTM is a type of ML model, and its use is conceptually aligned with 3GPP's NWDAF. However, the model name is non-standard and descriptive rather than a formal name. "Prediction accuracy" is a standard ML metric. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying an advanced ML model architecture, a performance target for the model itself (accuracy), and a fault-tolerant requirement. | 4 | The descriptive model name "lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism" is a bit clumsy, reducing readability slightly. | 5 | The goal to "Implement autonomous performance optimization" is a perfect fit for a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the goal (optimization) to the tool (ML model) and a quality metric for that tool (accuracy). | 5 | All concepts presented are consistent with an advanced, AI-driven network management strategy. | 4 | The intent is very detailed on the "how" (the ML model) but vague on the "what" (which network KPIs are being optimized). | 4.4 | A very complex and forward-looking intent that is slightly hindered by descriptive, non-standard naming and a lack of specific KPIs to optimize. |
| 56 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 470ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | "Response time" is a valid KPI. The methods are conceptually aligned with modern network management (e.g., NWDAF, ZSM). | 4 | The intent combines a performance target with advanced operational methods (prediction, automation), making it complex. | 5 | The request is concise and clear. | 5 | The intent to "Optimize performance" to a specific target is a core function of performance assurance. | 5 | The sentence logically connects the goal (response time) with the methods (analytics, remediation). | 5 | The specified methods and goal are consistent and represent a modern approach to network management. | 3 | The intent is missing the context of which service or application this 470ms response time applies to. | 4.4 | A strong, clear intent describing a modern, automated approach to performance management, but it lacks service context. |

| 58 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize deterministic performance achieving 827ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | "Deterministic performance" and "response time" are valid concepts, though 827ms is very high for anything considered "deterministic." The methods are aligned with modern management principles. | 4 | The intent combines a performance target with advanced operational methods (prediction, automation), making it complex. | 5 | The request is concise and clear. | 5 | The intent to "Optimize... performance" to a specific target is a core function of performance assurance. | 5 | The sentence logically connects the goal with the methods. | 3 | An 827ms response time is inconsistent with the goal of "deterministic performance," which usually implies low and predictable latency/jitter. | 3 | The intent is missing the context of which service or application this response time applies to. | 4.1 | A clear intent that is significantly weakened by the contradiction between its goal ("deterministic performance") and the specified high response time. |
| 59 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 56 core utilization and 79GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF and standard performance metrics.

| 63 | Deployment Intent | "Secure microservices architecture using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols, maintaining security boundaries in distributed service architectures." | 4 | 5G-AKA is correct. "256_NEA2" is incorrect (NEA2 is 128-bit). Applying UE authentication (5G-AKA) directly to a microservices architecture is a conceptual stretch; service mesh security typically uses other mechanisms like mTLS. | 4 | The intent addresses a complex topic: securing a microservices architecture, which is relevant for cloud-native NFs. | 4 | The language is clear, but the application of 5G-AKA is conceptually ambiguous in this context. | 3 | This describes the deployment of a security configuration, not a network function. It's more of a "Security Intent" or "Modification Intent." | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, linking the methods to the goal. | 3 | The use of 5G-AKA for inter-microservice authentication is inconsistent with typical service mesh security patterns. The "256_NEA2" error persists. | 4 | The intent states the security goals and methods clearly, though the methods are questionable. | 3.9 | An intent that addresses a relevant modern topic but is flawed by incorrect terminology and a questionable application of 3GPP security mechanisms. |

While this is part of deployment, it is provisioning infrastructure rather than a network function itself. | 3 | The intent is a straightforward resource provisioning request with specific hardware types. | 5 | The request is clear and unambiguous. | 4 | This is on the line between a "Deployment Intent" and a "Modification Intent" (if modifying an existing pool). It's deploying resources, so it's acceptable. | 5 | The structure is logical. | 5 | The parameters are consistent for provisioning compute resources. | 3 | It is incomplete because it doesn't state which "demanding network functions" these resources are for. | 4.1 | A clear hardware provisioning request that is correctly specified but lacks the context of the target workload. |

These values correspond to a GBR QoS Flow. | 5 | This is a complex service request, specifying multiple strict QoS parameters that require careful network configuration and resource reservation. | 5 | The language is clear and uses standard QoS terminology correctly. | 5 | The request to "Launch... a network service" is a clear deployment action. | 5 | The sentence logically defines the service characteristics and its purpose. | 5 | The specified GBR and PDB are consistent with a high-priority, latency-sensitive service. | 5 | The intent is complete for a service request, providing the key QoS parameters needed for its creation. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a service deployment intent, using correct 3GPP QoS terminology to define a service level objective. |
| 72 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network deterministic performance using fault-tolerant LSTM_Autoencoder behavioral anomaly detection with mission-critical Neural_Network predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive deterministic performance management." | 3 | While the concepts (monitoring, anomaly detection, prediction) are aligned with NWDAF, the terminology "LSTM_Autoencoder" and "Neural_Network predictive analytics" is generic ML terminology, not 3GPP-standardized. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying multiple ML model types and linking them together for a proactive management goal. | 4 | The intent is understandable, but the wording is a bit dense with buzzwords. | 5 | The goal of monitoring and managing performance fits perfectly within this intent type. | 5 | The sentence flows logically from the monitoring method to the analytics capability and the overall goal. | 5 | All the concepts (anomaly detection, predictive analytics) are consistent with a proactive performance management strategy. | 4 | The intent is very specific about the 'how' but doesn't define which metrics constitute "deterministic performance" (e.g., jitter, wander). | 4.4 | A complex, forward-looking intent that describes a sophisticated monitoring strategy, though it relies on generic ML terms. |
| 73 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 26 processing cores and 431GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | The intent describes modifying standard compute resources. "Execution timeout" is a common parameter but not specifically defined in 3GPP NF standards. | 4 | Specifies multiple parameters and links them to dual optimization goals, showing good complexity. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and clearly communicates the required changes and goals. | 5 | The request to "Adjust compute resources" is a clear example of a modification intent. | 5 | The intent flows logically from the specific changes to the desired outcomes. | 5 | The parameters are consistent with a resource modification task. | 4 | The intent is quite complete but does not specify which network function or service these resources are for. | 4.6 | A well-written, complex intent for resource modification that could be improved by naming the target function. |
| 74 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 16hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-AKA' is correct. "256_NEA2" is incorrect (NEA2 is 128-bit). The disjointed structure persists. | 4 | Specifies multiple alert triggers and a related notification, showing moderate complexity. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the relationship between the alerts and the key rotation notification could be better defined. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The structure combines two alert types with a third, separate notification topic. | 3 | The "256_NEA2" terminology contradicts 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the conditions for alerting. | 3.9 | Another notification intent that is flawed by the same incorrect security algorithm terminology. |

(Note: original had 0.008103, likely a typo, evaluating as if 10^-5) | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER) are fundamental QoS characteristics defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. A 2ms PDB and 10^-5 PER are consistent with URLLC services. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent as achieving such strict PDB and PER requires advanced traffic engineering, resource reservation, and quality assurance across multiple domains (RAN, transport, core). | 5 | The language is precise and uses standard 3GPP QoS terminology correctly. | 5 | The intent's goal is to configure and thus assure a certain level of performance, which fits the type perfectly. | 5 | The sentence logically states the QoS targets and the necessary actions to achieve them. | 5 | The strict PDB and low PER are consistent with each other and define a demanding but valid service class (e.g., URLLC). | 5 | The intent is complete for a QoS policy, providing the critical parameters for service configuration. | 5.0 | A perfect performance assurance intent that correctly uses 3GPP QoS parameters to define a strict URLLC-type service. |

Typically mission-critical services are high priority. This is a minor inconsistency. | 5 | The intent is complete for a service request, providing the key QoS parameters needed for its creation. | 4.9 | An excellent service deployment intent, with a minor inconsistency in priority descriptors. |
| 82 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant LSTM_Autoencoder anomaly detection with mission-critical 39% data sampling over 336days retention period. | 3 | While analytics are key to 5G (NWDAF), "LSTM_Autoencoder" is a specific ML technique, not a 3GPP standard. The intent doesn't link to a standard network function. | 4 | The intent shows complexity by specifying an ML model, data sampling rate, and a very long retention period, indicating a detailed analytics task. | 5 | The language is precise and clear for a data analytics team. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "compile intelligent analytics insights," which is a perfect match for an "Intent Report Request." | 5 | The request is well-structured, detailing the method, data handling, and timeframe for the report. | 5 | All parameters (ML model, sampling, retention) are consistent and relevant to an analytics task. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete but could be improved by specifying the data source or target metrics. | 4.4 | A technically specific and clear report request, though it relies on non-standardized ML models. |

| 84 | Deployment Intent | Implement autonomous CUSTOM_METRIC scaling from 3 to 30 instances with high-priority predictive high-capacity management and cost optimization. | 3 | The concept of autonomous scaling is central to NFV MANO. However, "CUSTOM_METRIC" makes this non-standard and implementation-specific. | 4 | The intent is complex, describing a predictive, metric-based autoscaling policy with a wide range and dual optimization goals. | 4 | The intent is clear, but "CUSTOM_METRIC" is by definition not a commonly understood term and would need a separate definition. | 4 | This is more of a policy configuration or modification than a deployment of a new service. It's deploying an autoscaling rule, which is borderline. | 5 | The sentence logically describes the scaling policy's parameters and goals. | 5 | All elements (scaling range, predictive management, cost optimization) are consistent with an advanced autoscaling strategy. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the "CUSTOM_METRIC" is not defined, making the rule impossible to implement. | 4.1 | A conceptually good intent for an advanced autoscaling policy, but it's critically incomplete without a definition of the custom metric. |
| 85 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 360.43ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 4 | GBR and PDB are correct QoS parameters. However, a PDB of 360ms is extremely high and contradicts the "strict" and "mission-critical" descriptors, which usually imply low latency. | 4 | The intent specifies QoS parameters for a new service. | 5 | The language is clear, although the values are questionable. | 5 | The request to "Launch... a network service" is a clear deployment action. | 5 | The sentence logically defines the service characteristics. | 2 | A 360ms PDB is not "strict" for most "mission-critical" applications. This is a significant internal inconsistency. | 5 | The intent is complete for a service request, providing the key QoS parameters. | 4.3 | A well-formed service creation intent that is severely undermined by an inconsistent and unrealistic Packet Delay Budget value for a mission-critical service. |

| 87 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-deterministic performance infrastructure using 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising deterministic performance characteristics. | 3 | 5G-AKA is correct. "256_NEA2" is incorrect (NEA2 is 128-bit). There is a typo ("high-priorityout"). | 4 | The intent links security mechanisms to a performance goal, which is a complex but critical consideration. | 3 | The typo "high-priorityout" reduces readability. | 5 | The intent focuses on assuring performance under specific security constraints, which fits its type. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical, stating the goal, the methods, and the constraint. | 3 | The "256_NEA2" terminology contradicts 3GPP standards. | 4 | The intent is clear on the goals but uses flawed terminology. | 3.9 | A conceptually strong intent that is flawed by a typo and the recurring incorrect encryption algorithm terminology. |

While this is part of deployment, it is provisioning infrastructure rather than a network function itself. | 3 | The intent is a straightforward resource provisioning request with specific hardware types. | 5 | The request is clear and unambiguous. | 4 | This is on the line between a "Deployment Intent" and a "Modification Intent". It's deploying resources, so it's acceptable. | 5 | The structure is logical. | 5 | The parameters are consistent for provisioning compute resources. | 3 | It is incomplete because it doesn't state which "demanding network functions" these resources are for. | 4.1 | A clear hardware provisioning request that is correctly specified but lacks the context of the target workload. |

| 199 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 18hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | Certificate-Based authentication is valid. 128-NEA2 (AES) is a correct and valid 3GPP encryption algorithm. | 4 | Specifies multiple alert triggers and a related notification, showing moderate complexity. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but still loosely combines distinct security alerts with a key rotation notification. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events fits the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 4 | The structure is acceptable but combines multiple, not directly related, notification events. | 5 | All specified security mechanisms are standard and consistent. | 4 | The conditions for alerting are clearly specified, making the intent actionable. | 4.4 | A good, standards-aligned notification request, although its structure could be improved by separating the alerts from the key rotation event. |
| 200 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 45ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.000001 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." (Note: original had 0.002209, likely a typo, evaluating as if 10^-6) | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER) are fundamental QoS characteristics defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. A 45ms PDB and 10^-6 PER are consistent with a high-reliability service (e.g., related to V2X or industrial applications). | 5 | This is a highly complex intent as achieving these strict QoS targets requires advanced traffic engineering and quality assurance. | 5 | The language is precise and uses standard 3GPP QoS terminology correctly. | 5 | The intent's goal is to configure and thus assure a certain level of performance, which fits the type perfectly. | 5 | The sentence logically states the QoS targets and the necessary actions to achieve them. | 5 | The PDB and very low PER are consistent with each other and define a demanding but valid service class. | 5 | The intent is complete for a QoS policy, providing the critical parameters for service configuration. | 5.0 | A perfect performance assurance intent that correctly uses 3GPP QoS parameters to define a strict, high-reliability service. |
