| 1 | Deployment Intent | Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with mission-critical high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 7700Mbps maximum high-throughput with mission-critical stringent 11.5ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms. | 5 | The description correctly uses 3GPP concepts like eMBB network slice, throughput, latency, and QoS. The specified performance values are ambitious but technically plausible for 5G. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying the slice type (eMBB), service characteristics (mission-critical), explicit KPIs (throughput, latency), and methods (traffic engineering, QoS). | 4 | The sentence is long and contains a slight redundancy ("high-high-throughput"), but it is well-structured and technically unambiguous for its target audience. | 5 | This is a classic example of a Deployment Intent, focusing on configuring or optimizing a network slice to meet specific performance objectives. | 5 | The components are logically linked: an eMBB slice is optimized for certain performance targets using relevant network mechanisms. | 5 | The combination of high throughput and stringent latency is consistent with mission-critical eMBB services. | 4 | The intent is very detailed with KPIs and mechanisms. Specifying the S-NSSAI (Slice Identifier) would have made it fully complete. | 4.7 | A well-defined and technically rich intent for network slice deployment and optimization. |
| 2 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-1602-1634] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" is a valid concept within NFV MANO but not a specific 3GPP term. | 4 | The intent combines specific performance KPIs (throughput, latency) with a particular assurance mechanism (intelligent scaling), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and easily parsable by both humans and automation systems. The instance ID is a good practice. | 5 | It clearly states a goal to achieve and maintain network performance, which perfectly aligns with a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The goal (high performance) is logically connected to the proposed solution (intelligent scaling). | 5 | The KPIs of 1000Mbps throughput and 5ms latency are demanding but consistent with a "high-performance networking" goal. | 4 | The intent provides clear performance targets and a mechanism type. The scope (e.g., which network function or service) is not specified but may be implicit. | 4.6 | An excellent example of a clear, actionable performance assurance intent with specific targets. |
| 3 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 16hours automated key management. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is a standard method. 256-NEA2 is a plausible reference to the 256-bit version of the AES-based NEA2 algorithm for 5G security (3GPP TS 33.501). | 3 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easy to understand. | 3 | This intent describes the deployment of security policies. While security can impact performance, its primary focus is not performance assurance, making it more of a security intent. | 4 | The different security elements (authentication, encryption, key management) are coherently grouped into a single policy statement. | 4 | The specified security mechanisms are consistent with each other. The link to "performance assurance" is weak but not contradictory. | 4 | It clearly specifies the authentication method, encryption algorithm, and key rotation policy, making it quite complete for a security rule. | 3.9 | A well-formed security intent that is misclassified as a performance assurance intent, affecting its relevance. |
| 4 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous performance optimization using lstm_with_attention_mechanism machine learning models with 91.7% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 4 | The intent leverages concepts from the ETSI ZSM (Zero-touch Network and Service Management) framework, which is highly relevant to 5G automation. The ML model mentioned is a valid and advanced technique. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the use of a sophisticated ML model (LSTM with attention), a performance metric for the model itself (91.7% accuracy), and the high-level goal (autonomous optimization). | 5 | The intent is well-written, clear, and uses specific technical terms correctly, making it highly readable for ML/automation engineers. | 5 | The description directly addresses autonomous performance management and optimization, which is a core aspect of advanced performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically connects the method (a specific ML model) with the goal (autonomous performance optimization). | 5 | All elements are consistent, describing a state-of-the-art approach to network performance management. | 4 | The intent is very specific about the method and its own performance. It could be more complete by defining what network parameters are being predicted or optimized. | 4.7 | An advanced, clear, and highly relevant intent describing a modern, AI/ML-driven approach to performance assurance. |
| 5 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 6hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' (Prime) is a valid authentication method (RFC 5448). 256-NEA2 is a plausible 5G encryption algorithm. The intent correctly identifies security events for alerting. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions (auth failure, security breach) and an additional notification event (key rotation), giving it moderate complexity. | 4 | The sentence structure is slightly confusing. It combines alerts on failures/breaches with notifications about a routine event (key rotation), which could be clearer if separated. | 5 | This is a perfect example of a Regular Notification Request, defining specific events that should trigger an alert or notification. | 3 | The coherence is average. Alerting on failures is logical, but adding a routine "key rotation event notification" to the same alert rule feels slightly disjointed. | 4 | The components are not contradictory, but the combination of reactive alerts (failures) and proactive notifications (rotations) in one line is slightly inconsistent in purpose. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the events to monitor. Specifying the notification channel (e.g., webhook, email) would make it more complete. | 3.9 | A good notification intent that could be improved by separating alerts for critical failures from notifications for routine events. |
| 6 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with mission-critical 16 x86_64 cores and 27GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | The specification of compute resources (cores, architecture, memory) aligns perfectly with NFV resource allocation principles defined by ETSI for deploying Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs/CNFs). | 4 | The intent is detailed, specifying the number of cores, CPU architecture, memory amount, and memory type, indicating a good level of complexity. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and contains all the necessary information for a resource provisioning request. | 5 | The intent clearly describes a provisioning action, which is a core function of deployment in an NFV environment. | 5 | The request for specific compute resources is a coherent and logical action for supporting demanding network functions. | 4 | The specification of DDR4 memory is slightly dated for a "high-performance" system in a modern context where DDR5 is common, but it is not inconsistent. 27GB is an unusual memory size but technically possible. | 4 | The intent is very specific about CPU and memory. It could be more complete by including storage and networking (e.g., NIC) requirements. | 4.6 | A clear, specific, and actionable intent for provisioning compute resources for a network function. |
| 7 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using fault-tolerant EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 128_NEA3 encryption with mission-critical 12hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication protocol. 128-NEA3 refers to the 128-bit version of the ZUC-based 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501), which is correct. "Fault-tolerant" is a desired system characteristic. | 4 | The intent specifies the authentication method, its desired characteristic (fault-tolerant), the encryption algorithm, and a key management policy, making it complex. | 5 | The language is precise, using correct technical terms, and is easy for a security engineer to understand. | 3 | Similar to a previous record, this is primarily a security intent focused on deploying robust security mechanisms. It is misclassified as a performance assurance intent. | 5 | The intent coherently groups multiple security requirements (authentication, encryption, key management) into a single, robust policy. | 5 | The components are consistent and describe a strong, mission-critical security posture. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying all key parameters for the security configuration. | 4.4 | An excellent and complete security intent that is incorrectly categorized, which lowers its relevance score significantly. |
| 8 | Deployment Intent | "Configure 5000ms performance averaging windows for 5QI_6_Video_TCP QoS flow management, providing consistent service quality and fair resource distribution." | 5 | The use of 5QI (5G QoS Identifier) is central to 5G QoS management (TS 23.501). 5QI 6 corresponds to a non-GBR flow often used for buffered video streaming. The concept of an averaging window is standard in performance management. | 4 | The intent is quite specific, mentioning the parameter to configure (averaging window), its value (5000ms), the context (5QI 6), and the high-level goal. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and directly translatable into a configuration command. | 5 | This is a clear deployment/configuration action aimed at setting a specific operational parameter for QoS management. | 5 | The intent logically links a specific configuration parameter (averaging window) to its relevant context (a specific QoS flow) and its intended outcome (consistent quality). | 5 | The parameters are consistent. A 5-second averaging window is a reasonable value for managing TCP-based video stream performance. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information (parameter, value, context) to be directly actionable. | 4.9 | An exemplary intent that is specific, actionable, and correctly aligned with 3GPP standards. |
| 9 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 297GB LPDDR5 memory and 7070GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with mission-critical deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | While not specifying a 3GPP service, the intent aligns with ETSI NFV MANO principles for resource validation. "Deterministic performance" is a key 5G concept, especially for URLLC. The hardware terms are correct. | 4 | The intent is detailed, specifying exact memory/storage amounts and types (LPDDR5, NVMe PCIe4) and the required analysis type. | 5 | The request is clear, unambiguous, and provides all necessary inputs for the feasibility study. | 5 | The intent's purpose is explicitly stated as "Evaluate," which perfectly matches the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | It coherently requests an evaluation of specific hardware resources and their performance impact. | 4 | The specified hardware is high-end and consistent. The memory size (297GB) and storage (7070GB) are unusually specific but technically plausible. | 5 | The intent is complete, defining exactly what needs to be checked and what kind of analysis is required. | 4.6 | A well-defined, clear, and complete intent for checking the feasibility of resource allocation. |
| 10 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 76 core utilization and 483GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly references a 5G core network function (AMF - Access and Mobility Management Function) and standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory consumption). "Deterministic performance" is a relevant 5G characteristic. | 5 | This is a complex request, asking for a report on a specific NF (AMF), covering multiple metrics, analyzing patterns, and providing high-priority, detailed recommendations. | 5 | The request is very clear, well-structured, and provides specific details about what the report should contain. | 5 | The intent explicitly asks to "Generate a... report," which is the exact purpose of an `Intent Report Request`. | 5 | All parts of the request are logically connected, from the target (AMF performance) to the analysis (utilization patterns) and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | The values for core count (76) and memory (483GB) for a large-scale AMF deployment are plausible and consistent with a performance analysis context. | 5 | The request is very complete, specifying the subject, metrics, analysis type, and the nature of the output. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a comprehensive, detailed, and actionable intent for generating a performance report. |
| 11 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with high-priority 8 x86_64 cores and 18GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | This aligns with ETSI NFV standards for resource provisioning. The use of specific, modern hardware terms (DDR5, x86_64) is correct and relevant. | 4 | The intent specifies core count, architecture, priority, memory size, and memory type, demonstrating good complexity. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and easily understandable for an orchestrator. | 5 | The word "Provision" clearly indicates a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The request for specific compute resources to support network functions is a coherent and logical statement. | 5 | The specified resources (8 cores, 18GB DDR5) are consistent with a modern high-performance virtualized function. | 4 | The intent is specific on CPU and memory. Adding storage and network requirements would make it fully complete. | 4.7 | A clear and actionable intent for provisioning modern compute resources. |
| 12 | Modification Intent | "Update security configuration using Certificate_Based authentication methods and 7hours key rotation policies, strengthening security posture and compliance requirements." | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is a standard mechanism. Key rotation policies are a best practice in security management and relevant to 3GPP security procedures. | 3 | The intent specifies two key aspects of a security configuration to be updated, giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and directly states the action ("Update") and the desired outcome ("strengthening security posture"). | 5 | The verb "Update" firmly places this in the `Modification Intent` category. | 5 | The intent coherently links the action (updating security config) to the reason (strengthening security and compliance). | 5 | The components of the update (authentication method, key rotation) are consistent with standard security practices. | 4 | It clearly states what to update. To be more complete, it could specify which systems or services this new configuration applies to. | 4.4 | A well-formed modification intent that clearly articulates a change to a security policy. |
| 13 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with high-priority 5hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based auth and 128-NEA3 (ZUC-based 5G encryption) are valid security concepts. The request correctly targets security-related events for alerting. | 4 | The intent combines multiple trigger conditions (auth failure, security breach) and a separate notification event (key rotation), with priorities and timing, making it moderately complex. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing. It mixes a high-priority alert for critical events with a notification for a routine event (key rotation), which should ideally be separate intents for clarity. | 5 | The intent clearly requests alerts and notifications, which is the purpose of a `Regular Notification Request`. | 3 | Coherence is impacted by mixing a critical, reactive alert (breach) with a proactive, routine notification (key rotation) in the same statement. | 4 | The elements themselves are not contradictory, but their combination within a single request is unusual from an operational standpoint. | 4 | The intent is specific about the events. Adding the notification channel would improve completeness. | 3.9 | A valid notification intent that suffers from poor sentence structure, combining unrelated event types into a single, slightly confusing request. |
| 14 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 39 core utilization and 120GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly refers to the AMF (a 5G core NF) and standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory consumption) relevant to its operation. | 5 | This is a complex request asking for a report on a specific NF, covering multiple metrics, pattern analysis, and detailed recommendations. | 5 | The request is clear, precise, and well-structured, making it easy to understand what is being asked for. | 5 | It explicitly asks to "Generate a... report," perfectly matching the `Intent Report Request` type. | 5 | The request logically flows from the target (AMF), to the analysis (metrics), to the desired output (recommendations). | 5 | The specified resources (39 cores, 120GB memory) are plausible for a moderately-sized AMF instance, making the context consistent. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the subject, metrics, analysis type, and the nature of the required output. | 5.0 | Another excellent example of a clear, complete, and actionable intent for a performance report. |
| 15 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 20hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method for 5G (TS 33.501). 256-NEA1 refers to the 256-bit version of the SNOW 3G-based 5G encryption algorithm, which is also a valid 3GPP standard. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying multiple event triggers, an algorithm, a priority, and a notification cadence. | 3 | Similar to record 13, the phrasing is confusing by bundling a critical alert (failure/breach) with a routine notification (key rotation). These should be separate. | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, aligning it perfectly with the specified intent type. | 3 | The coherence is weak because it merges a request for immediate, high-priority alerts on critical events with a notification about a scheduled, non-critical event. | 4 | The concepts are not contradictory, but the structure of the request is inconsistent from an operational logic perspective. | 4 | It clearly defines the events to monitor. Specifying the target audience or system for the notification would improve it. | 4.0 | A technically correct notification intent that is structurally flawed by combining disparate event types, reducing its clarity and coherence. |
| 16 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 97 core utilization and 123GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly names a key 5G core function (AMF) and uses standard metrics (core utilization, memory consumption) for performance analysis. | 5 | The request is complex, specifying the target NF, multiple metrics for pattern analysis, and the need for detailed, actionable recommendations. | 5 | The request is formulated with excellent clarity and precision, leaving no ambiguity. | 5 | The intent begins with "Generate comprehensive... report," which is a direct match for the `Intent Report Request` type. | 5 | There is a clear logical progression from identifying the subject (AMF) to defining the analysis scope and the expected outcome. | 5 | The resource values (97 cores, 123GB RAM) are plausible for a large-scale, high-load AMF, making the context consistent. | 5 | This intent is fully complete, providing all the necessary details for an analytics system to fulfill the request. | 5.0 | A flawless example of a detailed, coherent, and actionable report generation intent. |
| 17 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 300GB DDR4 memory and 674GB Optane storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | This aligns with ETSI NFV MANO principles. The hardware terms (DDR4, Optane) are correct. "Deterministic performance" is a key 5G concept, particularly relevant to URLLC services. | 4 | The intent is reasonably complex, specifying exact resource amounts and types and the kind of analysis required. | 5 | The request is stated clearly and is easy to parse. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" clearly signals that this is an `Intent Feasibility Check`. | 5 | The intent coherently asks for an evaluation of specific resources and their associated performance impact. | 5 | The combination of DDR4 memory and Optane (Persistent Memory) storage is a consistent and valid configuration for certain high-performance workloads. | 5 | The intent is complete, defining exactly what resources to check and what analysis to perform. | 4.7 | A clear, complete, and technically sound intent for a resource feasibility check. |
| 18 | Deployment Intent | Manage comprehensive GOLD_TIER Service Level Agreement enforcement guaranteeing 4538Mbps high-throughput performance and 36.6ms latency requirements through intelligent resource orchestration. | 5 | This intent uses concepts central to network slicing and service management, such as SLAs, tiers (Gold), and performance guarantees (throughput, latency), which are well-defined in 3GPP and operator practices. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, defining an SLA tier, specific multi-dimensional KPIs, and the high-level mechanism (intelligent resource orchestration) for enforcement. | 5 | The intent is well-written, clear, and describes a high-level business or service objective in technical terms. | 5 | The intent describes the management and enforcement of an SLA, which is a form of deployment and ongoing configuration of service policies. | 5 | The intent logically connects the high-level goal (enforce GOLD_TIER SLA) with the specific, measurable objectives (KPIs) and the means to achieve them. | 4 | The latency of 36.6ms seems a bit high for a "GOLD_TIER" service, which typically implies lower latency, but it is not strictly inconsistent, as tiers are operator-defined. | 5 | As a high-level service intent, it is very complete, specifying the service level, the guarantees, and the enforcement strategy. | 4.9 | An excellent, high-level service deployment intent that clearly translates business requirements into technical objectives. |
| 19 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 83 processing cores and 395GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 4 | Resource adjustment (scaling) is a fundamental concept in ETSI NFV MANO. The parameters (cores, memory, timeout) are standard for managing virtualized workloads. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple parameters to adjust (cores, memory, timeout) and provides the dual objectives for the adjustment, making it complex. | 5 | The language is clear and unambiguous, making it easy for an orchestration system to understand and execute. | 5 | The verb "Adjust" clearly indicates that this is a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent logically links the action (adjust resources) with the dual goals of optimizing performance and maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | The specified resource values are plausible, and the timeout constraint is a standard parameter for execution management. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing the exact target values for the resources and the associated execution constraint. | 4.7 | A well-defined and actionable intent for modifying compute resources with clear targets and objectives. |
| 20 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 41 core utilization and 430GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the 5G AMF network function and standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory). | 5 | The request is complex, asking for a report on a specific NF, covering multiple metrics, pattern analysis, and detailed recommendations. | 5 | The intent is formulated with excellent clarity, precision, and structure. | 5 | The explicit request to "Generate a... report" makes it a perfect `Intent Report Request`. | 5 | All parts of the request are logically connected and build upon each other, from the subject to the analysis and output. | 5 | The resource figures (41 cores, 430GB memory) are consistent with a large AMF instance under analysis. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, providing all the necessary details to generate the specified report. | 5.0 | Another perfect example of a comprehensive and actionable report generation intent. |
| 21 | Deployment Intent | "Launch medium priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 657.12ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 4 | The intent uses standard 3GPP QoS terms like Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB). However, the values are contradictory. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying service priority, a GBR, a PDB, the target application type (mission-critical), and desired performance characteristics. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Launch" clearly indicates a `Deployment Intent` for a new service. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the parameters for a new network service. | 1 | There is a major contradiction: a packet delay budget of 657.12ms is extremely high and completely inconsistent with the requirements of "mission-critical applications" which demand low latency. | 5 | From a syntax perspective, the intent is complete, specifying all key parameters for a QoS flow. | 4.1 | A syntactically well-formed intent that is rendered useless by a severe internal contradiction in its performance parameters. |
| 22 | Deployment Intent | "Provision edge computing resources featuring 6 processing cores and 9GB memory allocation, optimized for distributed computing workloads and real-time data analytics." | 5 | This aligns with ETSI MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) principles, which are tightly integrated with 5G. The specified resources and workloads are typical for an edge deployment. | 3 | The intent specifies the core count and memory size, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and easy to parse. | 5 | The word "Provision" directly signals a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | It logically connects the resource provisioning action with the target location (edge) and the intended workloads. | 5 | The specified resources (6 cores, 9GB memory) are consistent and plausible for an edge computing node. | 4 | The intent is clear on compute resources. Specifying storage and networking would make it more complete. | 4.6 | A clear and relevant intent for provisioning resources at the network edge. |
| 23 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 173GB DDR5 memory and 4938GB Optane storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | Aligns with ETSI NFV MANO concepts. The hardware terms (DDR5, Optane) are correct and modern. The analysis type is relevant for mission-critical 5G services. | 4 | The intent is detailed, specifying exact amounts and types of memory/storage and the required analysis context. | 5 | The request is clearly stated and provides all necessary information for the evaluation. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" makes this a clear `Intent Feasibility Check`. | 5 | The intent coherently requests an evaluation of specific hardware resources and their performance impact. | 4 | The memory (173GB) and storage (4938GB) values are unusually specific but technically possible. The hardware combination is consistent for high performance. | 5 | The intent is complete, defining what to check and how to check it. | 4.6 | A well-formed and complete intent for a resource feasibility check. |
| 24 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 14 core utilization and 24GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly references the 5G AMF and standard performance metrics relevant to virtualized network functions. | 5 | The request is complex, specifying the target, metrics, analysis type (patterns), and the desired output (recommendations). | 5 | The intent is very clear, well-structured, and unambiguous. | 5 | The request to "Generate a... report" perfectly aligns with the `Intent Report Request` type. | 5 | The components of the request are logically ordered and coherent. | 5 | The resource values (14 cores, 24GB memory) are plausible for a small to medium-sized AMF instance, making the context consistent. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, providing all necessary details for an analytics system. | 5.0 | An excellent, textbook example of a clear and actionable intent for a performance report. |

A GBR of 101Mbps and a PDB of ~25ms are plausible and consistent with requirements for many mission-critical applications like industrial control or real-time video. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing the key QoS parameters required to configure the service. | 4.9 | An excellent, well-defined deployment intent for a GBR QoS flow with consistent and plausible parameters. |
| 26 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 300ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard performance KPI. Predictive analytics and automated remediation are key concepts in ETSI ZSM and advanced network assurance. | 4 | The intent combines a target KPI (response time) with advanced assurance mechanisms (predictive analytics, automated remediation), making it complex. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly and concisely. | 5 | The goal is to "Optimize performance," which is a core tenet of `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | It logically connects the performance goal (300ms response time) with the methods used to achieve and maintain it. | 5 | The specified response time of 300ms is a reasonable target for certain types of services, and the assurance mechanisms are consistent with that goal. | 3 | The intent is somewhat incomplete as it doesn't specify which service or application the 300ms response time applies to. | 4.4 | A good, high-level performance assurance intent that clearly states the goal and methods, but lacks specific context. |
| 27 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 770140_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and Certificate_Based/128_NEA2 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 5 | Device density is a critical parameter for mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications) in 5G. Security overhead (authentication and encryption like NEA2) is a crucial consideration for performance, as per 3GPP security and performance studies. | 5 | This is a highly complex feasibility check, asking to evaluate the combined impact of two major factors (very high device density and specific security protocols) on overall system performance. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and uses specific, correct terminology. | 5 | The verbs "Consider" and "impact" clearly frame this as a feasibility/impact analysis request. | 5 | The intent coherently links the conditions to be evaluated (device density, security overhead) with the aspects to be assessed (performance, scalability). | 5 | The device density is extremely high, characteristic of massive IoT scenarios, and it is consistent to check the performance impact of security mechanisms in such a scenario. 128-NEA2 is a plausible 5G algorithm. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying exactly what factors need to be considered in the analysis. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a complex, relevant, and well-defined feasibility check for a demanding 5G use case. |

This aligns with ETSI NFV principles for VNF/CNF deployment. | 5 | The intent is complex, specifying the NF, its criticality, the exact number of cores, architecture, clock speed, and the constraints to consider. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and easy to understand for a capacity planning engineer or an orchestrator. | 5 | The verb "Assess... feasibility" directly matches the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | It coherently asks to assess the feasibility of deploying a specific NF on a defined hardware configuration against given performance constraints. | 5 | The parameters are consistent. A large number of ARM64 cores for a mission-critical AMF is a plausible scenario in modern cloud-native 5G deployments. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary inputs for the feasibility assessment. | 5.0 | An excellent, detailed, and technically sound feasibility check intent for a core network function. |
| 29 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 201938_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and Certificate_Based/256_NEA1 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 5 | Device density is a key 5G parameter (mMTC). Certificate-based auth and 256-NEA1 (SNOW 3G based 5G encryption) are valid 3GPP-related security mechanisms. Assessing their overhead is a valid concern. | 5 | This is a complex check, combining two significant factors (high device density, specific security) and evaluating their impact on multiple system aspects (performance, scalability). | 5 | The request is clear and uses specific, correct technical terms. | 5 | The verb "Consider" and the focus on "impact" clearly define this as a feasibility and impact analysis request. | 5 | The intent logically connects the factors to be analyzed with the system characteristics to be measured. | 5 | The parameters are consistent. High device density scenarios require careful analysis of security overhead, making this a very realistic and consistent request. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating the conditions and the evaluation criteria for the check. | 5.0 | Another perfect example of a comprehensive and relevant feasibility check for a massive IoT scenario. |
| 30 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with high-priority 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary 5G authentication method. 128-NEA3 is the ZUC-based 5G encryption algorithm. Both are correct 3GPP terms (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent combines multiple trigger conditions, a priority level, and a notification about a separate event, giving it moderate complexity. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing and operationally flawed, mixing critical alerts with routine notifications. These should be separate intents. | 5 | The purpose is to request alerts and notifications, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is low because it illogically groups a high-priority, reactive alert (failure/breach) with a scheduled, non-critical notification (key rotation). | 4 | The specified mechanisms are not contradictory, but the way the request is framed is inconsistent with standard operational procedures. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the events to be monitored. Completeness could be improved by specifying the notification channel. | 4.0 | A technically correct but poorly structured notification intent that merges unrelated events, reducing clarity. |

| 34 | Deployment Intent | "Implement comprehensive EAP_AKA_Prime authentication framework with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated 256_NEA1 encryption algorithms, providing multi-layered security protection for all network communications and data transactions." | 5 | EAP-AKA' (Prime) is a valid authentication method. 256-NEA1 is the 256-bit SNOW 3G algorithm for 5G. The intent correctly combines them into a security framework. "Research-grade" is descriptive fluff. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the authentication framework, a specific encryption algorithm with modifiers ("research-grade sophisticated"), and the overall security goal. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly verbose ("research-grade sophisticated"), but the core technical request is clear. | 5 | The verb "Implement" clearly indicates this is a `Deployment Intent` for a security framework. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the implementation of a security framework with its constituent parts and its high-level objective. | 5 | The specified authentication and encryption methods are consistent and can be used together to provide a high level of security. | 5 | The intent is complete in describing the desired security posture and the core mechanisms to be used. | 4.7 | A strong, detailed security deployment intent, despite some slightly exaggerated marketing-style language. |

The scope (which service or NF) is not specified. | 4.6 | A clear, well-formed performance assurance intent with specific targets and a defined mechanism. |
| 37 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication protocol. 128-NEA2 is the 128-bit AES encryption for 5G. The events are valid security concerns. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions and a notification for a separate event. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing by bundling a critical alert (failure/breach) with a routine notification (key rotation). This reduces clarity. | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, which is a perfect fit for the type. | 3 | The coherence is low because it illogically groups an immediate, reactive alert with a scheduled, proactive notification in one statement. | 4 | The elements are not contradictory, but the request's structure is inconsistent with operational best practices. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the events to monitor. Specifying the notification channel would improve completeness. | 3.7 | A technically valid but poorly structured notification intent that merges unrelated event types. |
| 38 | Modification Intent | "Update security configuration using 5G_AKA authentication methods and 1hours key rotation policies, strengthening security posture and compliance requirements." | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication and key agreement protocol for 5G, defined in 3GPP TS 33.501. Key rotation policies are a crucial part of security management. | 3 | The intent specifies two key parameters to be updated in the security configuration. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and directly states the action ("Update") and its purpose. | 5 | The verb "Update" clearly places this in the `Modification Intent` category. | 5 | The intent coherently links the configuration change to its high-level goals of improving security and meeting compliance. | 5 | Using 5G-AKA with a very frequent (1-hour) key rotation is a consistent policy for a very high-security environment. | 4 | The intent clearly states what to update. To be more complete, it could specify where this new configuration should be applied. | 4.6 | A clear, standards-aligned, and actionable intent to modify a security configuration. |

| 40 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 24hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a standard authentication protocol. 256-NEA2 is a plausible 5G encryption algorithm. The parameters are correct for a security policy. | 3 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters, giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly and is easy to understand. | 3 | This is primarily a security intent. While security choices affect performance, the intent's focus is on deploying security mechanisms, not assuring a performance KPI. | 5 | The intent coherently groups the required security mechanisms (authentication, encryption, key management) into a single policy. | 4 | The components are consistent. The only inconsistency is framing this security policy as "performance assurance." | 5 | The intent is complete for a security policy, specifying all the key parameters. | 4.1 | A clear and complete security intent that is misclassified as a performance assurance intent, reducing its relevance. |
| 41 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 115 core utilization and 105GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly identifies the 5G AMF and uses standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory). | 5 | The request is complex, specifying the target, multiple metrics, pattern analysis, and the need for detailed recommendations. | 5 | The request is very clear, precise, and well-structured. | 5 | The explicit request to "Generate a... report" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | All elements of the request are logically connected and coherent. | 5 | The resource values (115 cores, 105GB memory) are plausible for a very large AMF instance being analyzed. | 5 | The intent is fully complete, providing all the necessary information to fulfill the request. | 5.0 | A flawless example of a detailed, coherent, and actionable report generation intent. |
| 42 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 983ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI. Predictive analytics and automated remediation are key concepts in ETSI ZSM for closed-loop assurance. | 4 | The intent is complex, combining a target KPI, a priority, and the advanced mechanisms to be used for assurance. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly and concisely. | 5 | The goal "Optimize performance" aligns perfectly with `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | It logically connects the performance target with the high-priority methods used to achieve it. | 4 | A 983ms response time is quite high, but plausible for certain background services or non-interactive applications. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it lacks the context of which service or application the response time target applies to. | 4.3 | A good high-level performance assurance intent that is clear about the goal and methods but lacks specific application context. |

The parameters are plausible for a high-performance 5G slice. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying slice type, priority, KPIs with exact values, and the methods for optimization. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly verbose and repetitive ("high-priority," "high-high-throughput"), but the technical meaning remains clear. | 5 | The core action is to "Optimize" a network slice, which falls under the broad category of deployment and configuration management. | 5 | The intent logically connects the goal (optimize eMBB slice) with specific performance targets and the means to achieve them. | 4 | The latency of 45.3ms is a bit high for something described as "stringent," especially compared to other examples.

| 49 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 17hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a standard authentication protocol, and 128-NEA3 is the ZUC-based 5G encryption algorithm. The events are valid security triggers. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, combining different triggers, a criticality level, and a notification about a routine event. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing by bundling a critical alert (failure/breach) with a routine notification (key rotation). This is poor operational practice. | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is low. A "mission-critical" notification for a routine 17-hour key rotation is an odd combination, especially when grouped with actual failure alerts. | 3 | There's an inconsistency between labeling a routine, long-interval (17 hours) notification as "mission-critical." | 4 | The intent is clear about the events to monitor. Specifying the notification channel would improve it. | 3.7 | A technically valid but operationally confusing notification intent due to poor structure and inconsistent use of "mission-critical." |

It bundles an alert on critical failures with a notification on a routine (though frequent) event. | 5 | The intent clearly asks for alerts and notifications, matching the type. | 3 | The coherence is low. A critical alert and a routine notification should be configured separately for clarity and proper handling. The "mission-critical" label for a routine notification is also questionable. | 4 | The components are not contradictory in themselves, but their combination in a single request is inconsistent with operational logic. | 4 | It clearly defines the events to monitor. Adding the destination for the alert/notification would make it complete. | 4.0 | A technically sound notification intent that suffers from a recurring structural flaw of mixing critical alerts with routine notifications. |
| 53 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 21hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA and 128-NEA1 (SNOW 3G) are correct 3GPP security terms. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions and a notification about a separate event. | 3 | The sentence structure is again confusing, bundling critical alerts with a routine notification. | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is low because it illogically groups a reactive alert with a scheduled, non-critical notification. | 4 | The specified mechanisms are not contradictory, but the request's structure is inconsistent with standard operational procedures. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the events to be monitored. Specifying the notification channel would improve completeness. | 3.9 | Another example of a technically correct but poorly structured notification intent that merges unrelated event types. |
| 54 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 18 x86_64 processing cores at 2.54GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF, a 5G NF.

The performance values are plausible for 5G. | 5 | The intent is complex, detailing the slice type, service type, specific KPIs (throughput, latency), and the methods for optimization. | 4 | The description is well-structured and technically clear, with only a minor redundancy in "high-high-throughput." | 5 | The action "Optimize" a network slice falls under deployment and operational configuration. | 5 | The intent logically connects the goal (optimize slice) with the specific performance targets and the means to achieve them. | 5 | The specified KPIs of ~1.6Gbps and 13ms latency are consistent with a high-performance eMBB service. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing clear, measurable targets and the high-level strategy. | 4.9 | A very well-defined, complex, and actionable intent for network slice optimization. |

The events are appropriate for security monitoring. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying multiple triggers, a priority, and a notification about a routine event. | 3 | The sentence structure remains problematic, combining critical alerts with routine notifications, which impairs clarity. | 5 | The purpose is to request alerts and notifications, matching the intent type. | 3 | Coherence is low due to the illogical grouping of reactive, critical alerts with proactive, non-critical notifications. | 4 | The elements themselves are not contradictory, but the request's structure is inconsistent with operational best practices. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the events to monitor. Completeness could be improved by specifying the notification channel. | 3.9 | A notification intent with correct technical terms but a flawed structure that reduces its overall quality. |

"Distributed deployment" at the edge is a standard strategy. The repetition of "ultra-ultra" is stylistic but denotes extreme requirements. | 5 | This is a very complex intent, defining the service type (URLLC), deployment strategy (distributed edge), a very high device density, and the enabling goals. | 4 | The intent is slightly verbose with repetitions ("ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency"), but the overall meaning is clear. | 5 | The verb "Deploy" clearly marks this as a `Deployment Intent`. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent. Combining extreme URLLC with very high mMTC density is a challenging and somewhat conflicting goal, as the two services have different optimization priorities. | 4 | The consistency is slightly strained due to the mix of URLLC and mMTC requirements, which are typically addressed by different network slices and resource allocation strategies. | 5 | The intent is very complete in describing the desired infrastructure and its capabilities. | 4.4 | A very ambitious and complex deployment intent that pushes the boundaries by combining extreme URLLC and mMTC requirements. |
| 62 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-1662-1955] | 4 | 5G-AKA and 256-NEA2 are correct 3GPP security terms. The constraint of not compromising performance is key to performance assurance. The typo "high-priorityout" reduces readability. | 4 | The intent is complex as it sets a security requirement along with a critical performance constraint. | 3 | There is a clear typo ("high-priorityout") that damages readability and would likely fail automated parsing. | 4 | The intent's goal of securing infrastructure while guaranteeing performance aligns with performance assurance, although the primary action is security deployment. | 5 | It coherently states the goal (security) and the critical boundary condition (no performance compromise). | 5 | The request is internally consistent, highlighting the realistic trade-off between security and performance. | 4 | The intent is clear in its goal. It could be more complete by specifying which part of the infrastructure this applies to. | 4.1 | A sophisticated intent that correctly links security and performance, but is marred by a critical typo. |
| 63 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade NWDAF network function using Cisco SW_1.8.396 software on high-deterministic performance 7-core ARM64 architecture with 29GB DDR4 memory and 320GB SATA_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | Correctly identifies a 5G NF (NWDAF - Network Data Analytics Function). The hardware and software specifications align perfectly with ETSI NFV principles for VNF/CNF deployment. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the NF, vendor/software, and a full, detailed hardware configuration (CPU, RAM, Storage). | 5 | The request is extremely clear, detailed, and well-structured. | 5 | The verb "Deploy" is a direct match for `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently describes all aspects of the deployment, from software to the hardware platform. | 4 | The use of a SATA SSD is slightly inconsistent with a "high-deterministic performance" goal, where an NVMe drive would be more common, but it's not a major contradiction. | 5 | The intent is exceptionally complete, providing a full blueprint for the deployment. | 4.9 | An excellent, highly detailed, and actionable deployment intent for a key 5G analytics function. |

The lower clock speed (1.69GHz) is plausible for some power-efficient ARM server CPUs. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information to perform the assessment. | 5.0 | An excellent and detailed feasibility check intent. |
| 65 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 6hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based auth and 256-NEA2 are valid security concepts. The events are valid triggers for security alerts. | 4 | The intent is moderately complex, combining different triggers, a criticality level, and a notification about a routine event. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing by bundling a critical alert (failure/breach) with a routine notification (key rotation). | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | The coherence is low. A "mission-critical" notification for a routine 6-hour key rotation is an odd combination, especially when grouped with actual failure alerts. | 3 | There's an inconsistency between labeling a routine notification as "mission-critical." | 4 | The intent is clear about the events to monitor. Specifying the notification channel would improve it. | 3.7 | A technically valid but operationally confusing notification intent due to poor structure and inconsistent use of "mission-critical." |

The specified resources and workloads are typical for an edge deployment. | 3 | The intent specifies the core count and memory size, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and easy to parse. | 5 | The word "Provision" directly signals a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | It logically connects the resource provisioning action with the target location (edge) and the intended workloads. | 5 | The specified resources (3 cores, 10GB memory) are consistent and plausible for a small edge computing node. | 4 | The intent is clear on compute resources.

| 70 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 113 processing cores and 98GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Resource modification (cores, memory) is a standard NFV concept. "Transport network optimization" is a valid but very high-level goal. | 4 | The intent is complex as it combines a specific compute resource modification with a broad transport network goal. | 3 | The intent lacks clarity. It's unclear how modifying core resources "with" transport optimization should be interpreted. Are they two separate tasks in one intent, or is one meant to enable the other? | 5 | The verb "Modify" clearly indicates a `Modification Intent`. | 2 | The coherence is poor. It bundles a very specific compute resource change with a very vague transport network goal without explaining the relationship between them. | 3 | The two parts of the intent are not contradictory, but they are not well-integrated, leading to a lack of consistency in the request's focus. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. The "transport network optimization" part is too vague to be actionable. | 3.4 | An intent that suffers from a lack of coherence and clarity by vaguely combining a specific compute modification with a broad network goal. |
| 71 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 18hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based auth and 128-NEA1 (SNOW 3G) are valid security mechanisms. | 4 | The intent combines multiple triggers, a criticality level, and a notification about a routine event. | 3 | The sentence structure is again confusing, bundling critical alerts with a routine notification. | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, matching the type. | 3 | Coherence is low due to the illogical grouping of reactive alerts with proactive notifications. The "mission-critical" label for an 18-hour event is also questionable. | 3 | The label "mission-critical" is inconsistent with a routine, long-interval (18 hours) event. | 4 | It clearly defines the events to monitor. Adding the notification channel would improve completeness. | 3.7 | Another example of a technically correct but operationally confusing notification intent due to poor structure. |

It could be more complete by specifying which part of the infrastructure this applies to. | 4.1 | A sophisticated intent that correctly links security and performance, but is marred by a critical typo. |
| 73 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA and 256-NEA1 (SNOW 3G) are correct 3GPP security terms. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions and a notification about a separate event. | 3 | The sentence structure is again confusing, bundling critical alerts with a routine notification. | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, matching the type. | 3 | The coherence is low because it illogically groups a reactive alert with a scheduled, non-critical notification. | 4 | The specified mechanisms are not contradictory, but the request's structure is inconsistent with standard operational procedures. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the events to be monitored. Specifying the notification channel would improve completeness. | 3.9 | Another example of a technically correct but poorly structured notification intent that merges unrelated event types. |

The performance values are plausible for 5G. | 5 | The intent is complex, detailing the slice type, service type, specific KPIs, and optimization methods. | 4 | The description is clear and technically sound, with only a minor redundancy ("high-high-throughput"). | 5 | The action "Optimize" a network slice is a form of deployment/configuration management. | 5 | The intent logically connects the goal, the specific targets, and the means to achieve them. | 5 | The specified KPIs of ~4.4Gbps throughput and 22.5ms latency are consistent with a high-performance eMBB service. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing clear, measurable targets and the high-level strategy. | 4.9 | A very well-defined, complex, and actionable intent for network slice optimization. |

However, the values are contradictory. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying priority, GBR, PDB, and multiple "mission-critical" qualifiers. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the repeated use of "mission-critical" is redundant. | 5 | The verb "Launch" clearly indicates a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | It coherently describes the parameters for a new network service. | 1 | There is a major contradiction. A 309ms packet delay budget is very high and completely inconsistent with the requirements of "mission-critical" applications, which demand low latency. | 5 | From a syntax perspective, the intent is complete, specifying all key parameters for a QoS flow. | 4.0 | A syntactically well-formed intent that is rendered useless by a severe internal contradiction in its performance parameters.

Specifying the notification channel would improve completeness. | 3.7 | Another example of a technically correct but poorly structured notification intent that merges unrelated event types. |
| 94 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with 21hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-AKA' and 256-NEA1 (SNOW 3G) are valid security mechanisms. | 3 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly and is easy to understand. | 3 | This is primarily a security intent. While security choices affect performance, the intent's focus is on deploying security mechanisms, not assuring a performance KPI. | 5 | The intent coherently groups the required security mechanisms into a single policy. | 4 | The components are consistent. The only inconsistency is framing this security policy as "performance assurance." | 5 | The intent is complete for a security policy, specifying all the key parameters. | 4.1 | A clear and complete security intent that is misclassified as a performance assurance intent. |
| 95 | Deployment Intent | "Implement production-ready comprehensive 3_Sector antenna sectorization optimized for Urban_Macro deployment scenarios, maximizing spectral efficiency and user experience quality." | 5 | Antenna sectorization (e.g., 3-sector) and deployment scenarios (e.g., Urban Macro) are fundamental concepts in 3GPP RAN planning and design (e.g., TR 38.913). | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the sectorization strategy, the deployment scenario, and the high-level optimization goals. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and standard for mobile network planning. | 5 | The verb "Implement" clearly indicates this is a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links a specific RAN configuration (3-sector) to its appropriate environment (Urban Macro) and desired outcomes. | 5 | Using 3-sector antennas for an Urban Macro deployment is the most common and consistent strategy in cellular networks. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing a clear and actionable directive for a RAN site configuration. | 4.9 | An excellent, practical, and standards-aligned intent for RAN deployment. |
| 96 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 4minutes/6minutes/34minutes multi-tier escalation through gRPC notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | Multi-tier escalation, gRPC as a notification channel, and intelligent routing are all valid, modern concepts in network operations and automation, consistent with ETSI ZSM principles. | 4 | The intent is complex, defining a three-tier escalation timeline, the specific notification protocol (gRPC), and a routing requirement. | 5 | The intent is very clear, well-structured, and provides specific, actionable parameters. | 5 | The verb "Implement" for a notification scheme falls under the `Regular Notification Request` category. | 5 | The intent logically and coherently describes a complete escalation policy. | 5 | The parameters are consistent with setting up a robust, automated alerting and notification system. | 4 | The intent is very complete but lacks the trigger condition for the escalation. It defines the 'how' but not the 'what'. | 4.6 | A very well-defined intent for an escalation policy, which would be perfect if it included the event that triggers it. |
| 97 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 20hours automated key management. | 4 | Certificate-based auth and 256-NEA2 (AES) are valid security mechanisms. | 3 | The intent specifies three distinct security parameters. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly and is easy to understand. | 3 | This is primarily a security intent, not a performance assurance intent. | 5 | The intent coherently groups the required security mechanisms into a single policy. | 4 | The components are consistent.

| 98 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network performance using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with Prophet predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. [Instance-1698-2131]" | 5 | This correctly references specific, valid ML algorithms (Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, Prophet for time-series forecasting) that are highly relevant to modern, proactive network performance management as envisioned by ETSI ZSM. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying two distinct ML models for different tasks (anomaly detection, prediction) and linking them to the goal of proactive management. | 5 | The intent is technically dense but very clear and unambiguous for data scientists or ML engineers. | 5 | The goal "Monitor network performance... enabling proactive performance management" is a perfect fit for `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently combines two complementary ML techniques to build a comprehensive performance monitoring solution. | 5 | The use of Isolation Forest and Prophet together is a consistent and powerful approach for time-series network data analysis. | 4 | The intent is very specific about the methods.

| 99 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-deterministic performance infrastructure using fault-tolerant EAP_AKA_Prime authentication frameworks and 128_NEA1 encryption protocols with mission-criticalout compromising deterministic performance characteristics. | 4 | EAP-AKA' and 128-NEA1 (SNOW 3G) are valid. The goal of security without compromising deterministic performance is key for URLLC. The typo "mission-criticalout" is present. | 4 | The intent is complex as it sets a security requirement (with fault-tolerance) and a critical performance constraint. | 3 | There is a clear typo ("mission-criticalout") that damages readability and would likely fail automated parsing. | 4 | The intent's goal of securing infrastructure while guaranteeing performance aligns with performance assurance. | 5 | It coherently states the goal (security) and the critical boundary condition (no performance compromise). | 5 | The request is internally consistent, highlighting the realistic trade-off between security and performance. | 4 | The intent is clear in its goal. It could be more complete by specifying which part of the infrastructure this applies to. | 4.1 | A sophisticated intent that correctly links security and performance, but is marred by a critical typo. |

The values are consistent with a high-performance service. | 5 | The intent is complex, specifying priority, GBR, PDB, and the target application profile. | 4 | The intent is clear, but the repetition of "high-priority" is slightly redundant. | 5 | The verb "Launch" clearly indicates the creation of a new service, a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | It coherently defines all the key performance characteristics of the network service to be deployed. | 5 | The parameters are consistent: a high GBR (~771Mbps) and a low PDB (~5ms) are suitable for demanding, mission-critical applications like high-quality industrial video streaming. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing the key QoS parameters required to configure the GBR service. | 4.9 | A very well-defined and technically sound deployment intent for a demanding GBR QoS flow. |

| 104 | Modification Intent | Adjust Traditional_MIMO_4T4R radio parameters and Vertical_Beamforming beamforming configuration with high-priority core network coordination. | 5 | The terms Traditional MIMO (4T4R) and Vertical Beamforming are standard 3GPP/RAN concepts. The need for coordination with the core network is a valid operational consideration. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies modifications to two different aspects of the radio configuration and requires coordination with another network domain. | 4 | The phrase "with high-priority core network coordination" is slightly vague. It's unclear what specific coordination is required. The rest of the intent is clear. | 5 | The verb "Adjust" clearly indicates a `Modification Intent`. | 4 | It coherently links two RAN modifications. The link to core network coordination is logical but not well-defined. | 5 | Adjusting MIMO and beamforming parameters together is a consistent optimization strategy. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could be improved by specifying what kind of core network coordination is needed. | 4.4 | A good, relevant intent for RAN modification that could benefit from more specific details on the cross-domain coordination part. |

| 106 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 12hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA and 256-NEA2 (AES) are correct 3GPP security terms. | 4 | The intent combines multiple triggers, a criticality level, and a notification about a routine event. | 3 | The sentence structure is confusing by bundling a critical alert (failure/breach) with a routine notification (key rotation). | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, matching the type. | 3 | The coherence is low. A "mission-critical" notification for a routine 12-hour key rotation is an odd combination, especially when grouped with actual failure alerts. | 3 | The label "mission-critical" is inconsistent with a routine, half-day event. | 4 | It clearly defines the events to monitor. Adding the notification channel would improve completeness. | 3.9 | Another example of a technically correct but operationally confusing notification intent due to poor structure. |
