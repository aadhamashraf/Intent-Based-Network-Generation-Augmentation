| 1 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 1hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-TLS is a valid 5G authentication method. However, `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm; 5G NEA algorithms are 128-bit. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple conditions (authentication failure, security breach) and a related event context (key rotation), showing a good level of detail. | 4 | The intent is clearly worded and understandable. The term "1hours" is slightly awkward but parsable. | 5 | The description explicitly requests alerts and notifications, which perfectly aligns with the `Regular Notification Request` intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: "Alert on [condition A] or [condition B] with [context C]". | 5 | All components of the intent—authentication, security, and key management—are thematically related and internally consistent. | 3 | While it specifies the triggers, it lacks details on notification targets, severity levels, or the format of the alert. | 4.0 | A clear and relevant notification intent, but its correctness is impacted by the use of a non-standard encryption algorithm identifier. |

| 6 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 5hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication and NEA3 (ZUC) are valid 5G security concepts. The `128_` prefix is redundant as NEA3 is inherently 128-bit, but not incorrect. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple conditions (authentication failure, security breach) and a related event context (key rotation), showing a good level of detail. | 4 | The intent is clearly worded and understandable. The term "5hours" is slightly awkward but parsable. | 5 | The description explicitly requests alerts and notifications for specific security events, perfectly aligning with the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 5 | The structure is logical, outlining the conditions for the alert and the associated context in a clear manner. | 5 | The components—authentication, encryption (security breaches), and key rotation—are all related to network security and are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent is clear about triggers but lacks details on notification targets, severity, or the alert message content. | 4.1 | A well-structured and relevant notification intent using correct 3GPP security terminology. |
| 7 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. | 3 | `5G_AKA` is a standard authentication framework. However, `256_NEA2` is non-standard, as 3GPP's NEA2 (AES) is specified as a 128-bit algorithm. | 3 | The intent describes a high-level goal, linking security mechanisms (authentication, encryption) to a performance outcome, but lacks specific metrics. | 5 | The sentence is well-constructed, clear, and uses appropriate technical language to convey the goal. | 5 | The intent aims to assure performance under specific security conditions, which is a valid `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | The intent logically links the implementation of security protocols with the assurance of performance, creating a coherent statement. | 5 | The use of authentication and encryption frameworks to secure infrastructure is a consistent and valid concept. | 2 | This intent is very high-level. It lacks specific performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) to be assured, making it hard to measure. | 4.0 | A coherent and relevant high-level intent, but it is not actionable due to the lack of specific performance targets and use of a non-standard algorithm. |
| 8 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. | 5 | The intent refers to standard QoS parameters (throughput, latency) and a common operational process (automated escalation), all of which are standard concepts. | 4 | It specifies concrete performance metrics (throughput, latency) with values and a resulting action (escalation), making it technically detailed. | 5 | The intent is clearly and unambiguously worded, making it easy to parse for both humans and automation systems. | 5 | The description's core request is to "Alert" based on performance degradation, which is a perfect fit for a `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The statement is well-structured, presenting two distinct trigger conditions (throughput drop, latency increase) and the corresponding action. | 5 | The specified throughput and latency values are consistent with high-performance network requirements. The concept of automated escalation is also consistent. | 4 | The intent is good but could be improved by defining the "thresholds" and "acceptable limits" more precisely or specifying the escalation path. | 4.7 | A clear, specific, and actionable performance-based notification intent that is highly relevant to network operations. |
| 9 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 90 processing cores and 133GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The concepts of adjusting compute resources (cores, memory) and setting execution timeouts are standard practices in virtualized network function management. | 4 | The intent is highly specific, providing exact numbers for cores, memory, and timeout, and links them to performance and cost goals. | 5 | The description is very clear, precise, and well-structured, making it easy to translate into a resource modification command. | 5 | The intent's primary action is to "Adjust" existing resources, which directly corresponds to the `Modification Intent` type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the specific resource adjustments to the desired outcomes of performance and cost efficiency. | 5 | The parameters for cores, memory, and timeout are consistent with resource management for a computationally intensive application. | 4 | The intent is very clear but lacks the context of which network function or service is being modified. | 4.7 | An excellent, precise, and actionable intent for modifying compute resources with clear goals. |
| 10 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 1hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS and NEA3 are valid 5G security concepts. The `128_` prefix on NEA3 is redundant but not incorrect, as NEA3 is a 128-bit algorithm. | 3 | It specifies multiple trigger conditions (auth failure, security breach) and a related context (key rotation), showing good detail. | 4 | The description is clear and easy to understand, though "1hours" is a minor grammatical quirk. | 5 | The request to "Alert" on specific security events aligns perfectly with the `Regular Notification Request` intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, clearly stating the conditions for the alert and the associated context. | 5 | All components—authentication, security breaches, and key rotation—are related to network security and are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent specifies triggers well but lacks information on the notification channel, recipients, or severity. | 4.1 | A well-formed notification intent using correct 3GPP security terms, relevant to its type. |
| 11 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services monitoring with LSTM_Autoencoder behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. [Instance-411-5886] | 5 | The intent correctly references eMBB (enhanced mobile broadband) and uses a valid, advanced technique (LSTM Autoencoder) for anomaly detection, which is a recognized approach. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the service type (eMBB), the monitoring method (anomaly detection), the specific algorithm (LSTM_Autoencoder), and the action (alerting). | 4 | The phrasing "high-high-throughput" is slightly repetitive, but the overall sentence is clear and technically understandable. | 5 | The core of the intent is about "proactive alerting for performance degradation," which squarely falls under `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the service to be monitored, the analytical method used for monitoring, and the resulting notification action. | 5 | The use of an LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection in a high-throughput eMBB service is a consistent and logical application of AI/ML in networking. | 4 | The intent is quite specific but could be improved by defining the performance metrics to be monitored (e.g., jitter, packet loss). | 4.6 | A sophisticated and modern notification intent that effectively combines service type with advanced AI/ML monitoring techniques. |
| 12 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 92 processing cores and 33GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core and memory for network functions is standard. "Transport network optimization" is a valid concept, though its connection here is slightly vague. | 3 | It specifies exact core and memory values but the "transport network optimization" part is generic and lacks detail. | 4 | The sentence is understandable, but the phrase "with transport network optimization" is appended without clear integration, slightly reducing clarity. | 5 | The primary action is to "Modify" core network resources, which is a direct match for the `Modification Intent` type. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent, but the relationship between the compute resource modification and transport network optimization could be clearer. | 4 | While compute and transport are related, the intent doesn't specify how they are being modified consistently. It feels like two separate intents merged. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function is being modified or what the transport optimization entails. | 3.9 | A valid modification intent for compute resources, but it becomes vague and incomplete by adding an undefined "transport network optimization." |
| 13 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 17hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | `5G_AKA` is a standard authentication method. However, `256_NEA2` is not a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm as NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple conditions (authentication failure, security breach) and a related event context (key rotation), showing good detail. | 4 | The intent is clearly worded and easy to understand. The use of "17hours" is slightly unnatural but clear. | 5 | The description explicitly requests alerts on specific security events, which is the primary purpose of a `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The structure is logical: "Alert on [condition A] or [condition B] with [context C]". | 5 | All components—authentication, security breaches, and key rotation—are related to network security and are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent is clear on the triggers but lacks details on notification targets, severity, or the alert message format. | 4.0 | A relevant and well-structured notification intent whose technical correctness is weakened by the use of a non-standard encryption algorithm. |
| 14 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 6hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | `EAP-AKA'` (Prime) is a valid authentication protocol. However, `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm as NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple conditions (authentication failure, security breach) and a related event context (key rotation), showing good detail. | 4 | The intent is clearly worded and easy to understand. The use of "6hours" is slightly unnatural but clear. | 5 | The description explicitly requests alerts on specific security events, which is the primary purpose of a `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The structure is logical: "Alert on [condition A] or [condition B] with [context C]". | 5 | All components—authentication, security breaches, and key rotation—are related to network security and are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but is incomplete regarding the notification destination, format, and severity level. | 4.0 | A clear and relevant notification intent, but its standards alignment is compromised by the inclusion of a non-standard encryption algorithm. |
| 15 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 97 core utilization and 476GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting performance reports on network functions like the AMF, focusing on CPU and memory, is a standard and crucial operational task. | 4 | The intent is quite specific, naming the network function (AMF), the exact metrics (core utilization, memory consumption), and the desired output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | The description is very clear, well-structured, and uses precise terminology, making it easily understandable. | 5 | The request to "Generate comprehensive... report" is a direct and perfect match for the `Intent Report Request` type. | 5 | The intent flows logically from the request (generate report) to the subject (AMF performance) and the desired outcome (recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing core and memory usage to provide optimization recommendations is a consistent and logical process for performance management. | 4 | This is a strong and complete intent for a report, though it could be enhanced by specifying the time window for the analysis. | 4.7 | An excellent, specific, and actionable request for a performance report that is highly relevant to network operations. |
| 16 | Modification Intent | "Update artificial intelligence models to lstm_with_attention_mechanism achieving 90.94% prediction accuracy with multi_objective_genetic_algorithm optimization algorithms, enhancing intelligent network operations." | 5 | The terminology used (LSTM with attention, prediction accuracy, multi-objective genetic algorithm) represents valid and advanced concepts in applied AI/ML. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent specifying the new model type, a target performance metric with a precise value, and the optimization algorithm to be used. | 5 | The description is technically dense but very clear and well-structured for someone in the field of MLOps or network automation. | 5 | The core action is to "Update" a system component (AI models), which is a clear `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the change (new model), the goal (accuracy), the method (optimization algorithm), and the overall purpose. | 5 | The components are consistent; using a genetic algorithm to optimize an LSTM model for better accuracy is a standard practice in machine learning. | 4 | The intent is very detailed but lacks the context of which network service or function this AI model serves. | 4.9 | An outstanding, technically sophisticated modification intent that clearly specifies a complex update to an AI/ML system. |
| 17 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 4 core utilization and 287GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting reports on AMF performance, focusing on metrics like CPU and memory for deterministic behavior, is a valid and standard operational requirement. | 4 | The intent is specific, naming the NF (AMF), the type of performance (deterministic), the metrics (core utilization, memory), and the output (recommendations). | 5 | The description is clear, well-structured, and uses precise terminology, making it easily parsable. | 5 | The request to "Generate comprehensive... report" is a direct match for the `Intent Report Request` type. | 5 | The intent logically defines the report's scope (AMF deterministic performance) and its contents (analysis and recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing resource consumption to ensure deterministic performance and provide optimization advice is a coherent and consistent task. | 4 | This is a strong intent, but specifying the reporting period or time window for the analysis would make it more complete. | 4.7 | A clear, specific, and actionable request for a performance report on a critical network function. |
| 18 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 100GB DDR5 memory and 7129GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 5 | The components (DDR5, SATA SSD) are standard hardware types, and evaluating their requirements and performance impact is a standard part of system design and feasibility analysis. | 3 | The intent is specific about the hardware types and quantities but is simpler than analyzing a full service; it's a hardware-level check. | 4 | The description is clear and concise, but it could be improved by specifying what application or service these resources are for. | 5 | The request to "Evaluate... requirements" with impact analysis directly aligns with the purpose of an `Intent Feasibility Check`. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking the evaluation of hardware requirements to the necessary performance impact analysis. | 5 | The specified memory and storage components are consistent and represent a plausible, though unbalanced, hardware configuration. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it lacks the context of the workload or network function that will use these resources. | 4.3 | A valid but incomplete feasibility check that is clear about the hardware but misses the application context. |
| 19 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 20hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. However, `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm (NEA1 is 128-bit). The priority tag is a good addition. | 4 | It specifies multiple triggers, a priority level, and a specific context (key rotation), making it reasonably detailed. | 4 | The intent is clearly worded and easy to understand. The term "20hours" is a minor grammatical awkwardness. | 5 | The description explicitly requests an "Alert," making it a clear `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The structure is logical, outlining the conditions, priority, and context for the requested notification. | 5 | All components—authentication, security breaches, and key rotation—are related to network security and are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent specifies triggers and priority but lacks details on the notification channel or recipients. | 4.1 | A good notification intent with useful details like priority, but its standards alignment is flawed due to the non-standard encryption algorithm. |
| 20 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 14hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS and NEA1 are valid 5G security mechanisms. The `128_` prefix is redundant but not incorrect. The inclusion of priority is good. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers, a priority level, and a related context (key rotation), providing good technical detail. | 4 | The intent is clearly worded and understandable, with "14hours" being a minor non-standard phrasing. | 5 | The request to "Alert" on specific events is a perfect match for the `Regular Notification Request` intent type. | 5 | The intent is structured logically, defining the conditions, priority, and context for the notification. | 5 | All elements—authentication, security breaches, and key rotation—are thematically consistent within the security domain. | 3 | The intent is clear on triggers but lacks details about the notification target, format, or specific actions to be taken. | 4.3 | A well-formed and relevant notification intent using correct 3GPP security terms and a useful priority qualifier. |
| 21 | Deployment Intent | "Secure multi-domain orchestration using HMAC_SHA384 key derivation functions with high-priority 128_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 24hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle." | 5 | The security concepts mentioned—multi-domain orchestration, HMAC-SHA384, KDFs, and automated key rotation—are all standard and advanced practices in modern secure systems design. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the security goal, the cryptographic functions, key length, rotation policy, and overall lifecycle context. | 5 | The description is technically dense but clear, precise, and well-structured for a security or orchestration engineer. | 4 | While it describes a security configuration for a deployment, the primary action is "Secure...using" rather than "Deploy." It fits, but less directly than deploying a specific NF. | 5 | The intent coherently links the security mechanism (HMAC), its parameters (key length), its management policy (rotation), and its purpose. | 5 | The use of HMAC-SHA384 with 128-bit keys and a 24-hour rotation policy is a consistent and sound security configuration. | 4 | The intent is very specific about the security policy but could be more complete by naming the orchestration system or domains it applies to. | 4.7 | An excellent, technically detailed intent describing a robust security policy for an orchestration environment. |
| 22 | Performance Assurance Intent | Establish cognitive performance assurance using lstm_with high-priority_attention_mechanism neural networks with high-priority deep learning for intelligent network optimization. | 4 | The intent uses valid and advanced AI/ML terms (LSTM with attention, deep learning) in the context of network performance, a recognized approach (e.g., NWDAF in 5G). The model name is a bit clumsy. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the goal (cognitive performance assurance), the technology (neural networks), a specific architecture (LSTM with attention), and the purpose (optimization). | 3 | The model name `lstm_with high-priority_attention_mechanism` is awkwardly constructed. "high-priority deep learning" is also a vague and slightly ungrammatical phrase. | 5 | The goal to "Establish cognitive performance assurance" clearly aligns with the `Performance Assurance Intent` type. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the desired state (performance assurance) with the advanced methods (AI/ML) intended to achieve it. | 5 | The use of advanced neural networks for intelligent network optimization is a consistent and logical concept. | 2 | This intent is a high-level strategic goal. It is not actionable without specific performance metrics, services to optimize, or data sources. | 4.0 | A forward-looking, strategically relevant intent, but its readability is slightly poor and it lacks the specific, measurable targets needed for implementation. |
| 23 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications monitoring with Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for deterministic performance degradation. | 5 | The intent correctly references URLLC, a key 5G service category, and proposes using a valid anomaly detection algorithm (Isolation Forest) for monitoring, which is a sound technical approach. | 5 | This is a complex intent, specifying the service type (URLLC), application class (mission-critical), monitoring technique (anomaly detection), algorithm (Isolation_Forest), and trigger (performance degradation). | 3 | The repetitions ("ultra-ultra-reliable," "low-ultra-low latency") are excessive and reduce clarity. The core message is understandable but poorly phrased. | 5 | The core request for "proactive alerting for deterministic performance degradation" is a perfect fit for a `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The intent logically connects the service being monitored (URLLC), the method of monitoring (Isolation Forest), and the notification trigger. | 5 | Using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection on URLLC performance metrics is a consistent and appropriate application of ML in 5G networks. | 4 | The intent is quite specific but could be improved by defining the exact performance metrics for URLLC that are being monitored. | 4.6 | A technically sophisticated and relevant notification intent, though its readability suffers from stylistic issues like word repetition. |
| 24 | Modification Intent | "Adjust 0.008613 packet error rate tolerance and SHALL_NOT_PREEMPT preemption capabilities, optimizing network reliability and priority handling." | 5 | Packet Error Rate (PER) and preemption capability (e.g., ARP preemption capability) are standard QoS parameters defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 for 5QI profiles. `SHALL_NOT_PREEMPT` is a valid setting. | 4 | The intent is specific, providing an exact value for PER and a standard setting for preemption, linking them to network-level goals. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and uses standard terminology, making it easily parsable by an automation system. | 5 | The request to "Adjust" specific network parameters is a direct and clear `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the modification of specific QoS parameters (PER, preemption) to the desired outcomes (reliability, priority handling). | 5 | Adjusting PER and preemption settings together is a consistent action when configuring QoS for a specific traffic class. | 4 | The intent is very clear but lacks the context of which QoS Flow, network slice, or service this modification applies to. | 4.7 | An excellent, technically precise modification intent that correctly uses 3GPP QoS parameters. |
| 25 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 92 x86_64 processing cores at 2.5GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies a 5G network function (AMF), a standard architecture (`x86_64`), and relevant parameters (cores, clock speed) for a feasibility study. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the NF, core count, architecture, and clock speed, and frames the analysis around computational and performance needs. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and professional, making the request easy to understand and act upon. | 5 | The request to "Assess... feasibility" for a deployment is the exact purpose of an `Intent Feasibility Check`. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking the proposed hardware configuration to the key analysis criteria (computational requirements, performance). | 5 | The specified hardware (92 x86_64 cores at 2.5GHz) is a consistent and plausible configuration for a high-capacity AMF. | 4 | To be more complete, the intent could specify the expected load on the AMF (e.g., number of subscribers or PDU sessions). | 4.7 | A strong and clear feasibility check for a critical network function, providing specific hardware parameters for the assessment. |
| 26 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 10Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | The intent uses standard and correct terminology for RAN technologies (`Traditional_MIMO_4T4R`, `Horizontal_Beamforming`) and backhaul capacity. | 4 | This intent specifies multiple modifications—reconfiguring antenna systems, optimizing beamforming, and enhancing backhaul—making it a complex, multi-part task. | 5 | The description is well-structured and uses clear technical language to define the set of modifications and their goals. | 5 | The primary action is to "Reconfigure" and "enhance" existing network elements, which squarely falls under `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently groups related modifications (antenna, beamforming, backhaul) that collectively contribute to the goals (coverage, performance). | 5 | Modifying RAN elements and enhancing backhaul capacity are consistent and often concurrent activities to improve overall site performance. | 4 | The intent is specific but could be improved by identifying the specific cell sites or geographic area where this reconfiguration should apply. | 4.7 | An excellent and realistic modification intent that combines several related RAN and transport changes to achieve a clear performance goal. |
| 27 | Deployment Intent | Orchestrate deployment using Airflow AI-enhanced workflows with Terraform infrastructure-as-code and intelligent automation. | 5 | The tools mentioned (Airflow, Terraform) are industry-standard for orchestration and IaC. The concepts of AI-enhanced workflows and intelligent automation are current and relevant. | 4 | This intent describes a complex, meta-level deployment strategy, specifying the orchestration tools and methodologies rather than the network function itself. | 5 | The description is clear and uses well-understood terms from the DevOps and automation domains. | 5 | The intent explicitly states to "Orchestrate deployment," directly aligning it with the `Deployment Intent` type, albeit at a process level. | 5 | The intent logically combines different layers of an automation strategy: orchestration engine (Airflow), IaC tool (Terraform), and intelligence layer (AI). | 5 | The combined use of Airflow, Terraform, and AI for orchestration is a consistent and modern approach to network automation. | 3 | This is an intent about *how* to deploy, not *what* to deploy. It is incomplete as it lacks the target service or network function to be deployed. | 4.6 | A sophisticated intent describing a modern deployment methodology, but it's a meta-intent that needs to be paired with a specific deployment target. |
| 28 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 4hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method. However, `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm; NEA1 is 128-bit. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple conditions (authentication failure, security breach) and a related event context (key rotation), showing a good level of detail. | 4 | The intent is clearly worded and easy to understand. The term "4hours" is slightly awkward but parsable. | 5 | The description explicitly requests alerts and notifications, which perfectly aligns with the `Regular Notification Request` intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: "Alert on [condition A] or [condition B] with [context C]". | 5 | All components of the intent—authentication, security, and key management—are thematically related and internally consistent. | 3 | While it specifies the triggers, it lacks details on notification targets, severity levels, or the format of the alert. | 4.0 | A clear and relevant notification intent, but its correctness is impacted by the use of a non-standard encryption algorithm identifier. |

However, `256_NEA2` is non-standard, as 3GPP's NEA2 (AES) is specified as a 128-bit algorithm. | 3 | The intent describes a high-level goal, linking security mechanisms to a performance outcome, but lacks specific metrics. | 3 | The typo "high-priorityout" instead of "without" significantly harms readability and makes the sentence's meaning ambiguous. | 5 | The intent aims to assure performance under specific security conditions, which is a valid `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 4 | The intent attempts to link security implementation with performance assurance, but the typo makes the connection confusing. | 5 | Using authentication and encryption to secure infrastructure is a consistent and valid concept. | 2 | This intent is very high-level and lacks specific performance metrics. The typo makes the constraint unclear. | 3.6 | A thematically relevant intent that is severely hampered by a critical typo, use of a non-standard algorithm, and a lack of specific, measurable performance targets. |
| 149 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 128_NEA3 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication and `NEA3` are valid 5G security mechanisms. `128_NEA3` is redundant but correct. | 3 | The intent describes a high-level goal, linking security mechanisms to a performance outcome, but lacks specific metrics. | 5 | The sentence is well-constructed, clear, and uses appropriate technical language to convey the goal. | 5 | The intent aims to assure performance under specific security conditions, which is a valid `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | The intent logically links the implementation of security protocols with the assurance of performance, creating a coherent statement. | 5 | The use of authentication and encryption frameworks to secure infrastructure is a consistent and valid concept. | 2 | This intent is very high-level.

| 152 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 14 processing cores and 205GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core and memory for network functions is standard. "Transport network optimization" is valid, but its connection here is slightly vague. | 3 | It specifies exact core and memory values but the "transport network optimization" part is generic and lacks detail. | 4 | The sentence is understandable, but the phrase "with transport network optimization" is appended without clear integration, slightly reducing clarity. | 5 | The primary action is to "Modify" core network resources, which is a direct match for the `Modification Intent` type. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent, but the relationship between the compute resource modification and transport network optimization could be clearer. | 4 | While compute and transport are related, the intent doesn't specify how they are being modified consistently. It feels like two separate intents merged. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function is being modified or what the transport optimization entails. | 3.9 | A valid modification intent for compute resources, but it becomes vague and incomplete by adding an undefined "transport network optimization." |

Coordinating RAN changes with the core network is a valid and often necessary step. | 4 | The intent specifies the technologies to be adjusted (MIMO, beamforming) and requires coordination with another domain (core network), making it complex. | 4 | The intent is clear, but "radio parameters" is a very broad term. Specifying which parameters would improve it. | 5 | The primary action is to "Adjust" existing configurations, which is a clear `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the modification of RAN configurations with the need for coordination with the core network. | 5 | Adjusting advanced RAN features like Massive MIMO and 3D beamforming often requires corresponding adjustments or awareness in the core network, making this a consistent requirement. | 3 | This intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify *what* the new parameters/configurations should be, or what kind of coordination is needed.

The focus on establishing a monitoring system makes it a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the detection mechanism with the response procedure (escalation), creating a complete security monitoring loop. | 5 | The use of anomaly detection for security events coupled with a very rapid escalation policy is a consistent and effective security strategy for mission-critical systems. | 4 | The intent is very specific on the process but could be more complete by defining the data sources or types of security events to monitor. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for deploying a sophisticated security event monitoring and response process. |

The phrase "demanding network functions" is generic. | 5 | The language is precise and technically clear, making it suitable for direct interpretation by a resource orchestrator. | 5 | The request to "Provision... compute resources" is a clear `Deployment Intent` focused on infrastructure. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the resources to be provisioned and their intended purpose (demanding NFs). | 5 | 5 ARM cores with 25GB of modern DDR5 RAM is a consistent and plausible resource block for a specific network workload. | 3 | This intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function to deploy on these resources, only that they should be provisioned. | 4.4 | A clear and simple infrastructure provisioning intent, which serves as a prerequisite for a subsequent network function deployment. |
| 179 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 128_NEA1 encryption with 8hours automated key management. | 4 | `EAP-AKA'` and `NEA1` are standard 5G security mechanisms. `128_NEA1` is redundant but correct. | 3 | The intent connects security parameters to a generic "performance assurance" goal without defining any specific, measurable performance targets. | 4 | The description is well-phrased and technically clear, though the "8hours" phrasing is slightly unnatural. | 5 | The goal of "performance assurance" directly aligns with the `Performance Assurance Intent` type. | 5 | The intent logically links the security configuration (authentication, encryption, key management) to the overall performance goal. | 5 | The combination of EAP-AKA', NEA1 encryption, and automated key management is a consistent security policy. | 2 | This intent is too high-level to be actionable.

The use of "17hours" is slightly unnatural but clear. | 5 | The description explicitly requests alerts on specific security events, which is the primary purpose of a `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The structure is logical: "Alert on [condition A] or [condition B] with [context C]". | 5 | All components—authentication, security breaches, and key rotation—are related to network security and are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but is incomplete regarding the notification destination, format, and severity level. | 4.0 | A clear and relevant notification intent, but its standards alignment is compromised by the inclusion of a non-standard encryption algorithm. |
