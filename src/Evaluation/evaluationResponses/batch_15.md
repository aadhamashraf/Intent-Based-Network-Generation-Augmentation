Applying this to orchestration is aligned with securing management interfaces (e.g., as discussed in 3GPP TS 33.501). | 5 | This is a complex security deployment, specifying the algorithm, key length, rotation policy, and scope (multi-domain orchestration). | 5 | The intent is well-written, technically precise, and easy to understand for a security engineer. | 5 | The intent describes the implementation ("using HMAC_SHA256...") of a security control, which falls under deployment. | 5 | The intent logically connects the security mechanism, its parameters, and the overarching goal of maintaining security posture. | 5 | All security parameters (HMAC-SHA256, 256-bit keys, key rotation) are consistent with establishing a strong security posture. | 5 | The intent provides a complete set of parameters for deploying this specific security control. | 5.0 | An excellent, highly detailed, and standards-aligned security deployment intent. |
| 12 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 18 processing cores and 83GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | Modifying core network resources is a standard operation. However, "transport network optimization" is vague and its direct link to core CPU/memory changes is not explicit. | 3 | It's a resource modification, but the link to "transport network optimization" is underspecified, making the scope unclear. | 3 | The phrase "with transport network optimization" is ambiguous. It's unclear if this is a goal, a concurrent action, or a related configuration. | 5 | "Modify core network" clearly aligns with "Modification Intent." | 3 | The connection between adjusting core NF compute resources and optimizing the transport network is not coherently explained. | 4 | While not contradictory, the relationship between the two clauses is not clearly established. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't explain how the resource modification relates to or enables transport optimization. | 3.6 | The intent is clear about the resource change but lacks coherence and completeness regarding the transport optimization aspect. |
| 13 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 12hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-AKA' is a standard authentication protocol (RFC 5448) and 128-NEA2 is a 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). Alerting on failures is a standard security monitoring practice. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, distinct trigger conditions (auth failure, security breach) and a related event notification (key rotation), making it moderately complex. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but "with 12hours key rotation event notifications" could be interpreted as either a trigger or a related piece of information to include in the alert. | 5 | "Alert on..." is a perfect fit for a "Regular Notification Request." | 4 | It's coherent in that all parts relate to security, but the relationship between the failure alerts and the key rotation notification is slightly ambiguous. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are consistent with 5G systems. | 4 | The intent could be more complete by specifying the severity or the notification channel. | 4.4 | A good and relevant security notification intent, though the wording could be slightly clearer. |
| 14 | Deployment Intent | Monitor security events using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with high-priority 1minutes/12minutes/35minutes escalation policies, ensuring rapid response to security incidents. | 4 | While Isolation Forest is a specific ML algorithm, not a 3GPP standard, using anomaly detection for security monitoring is aligned with modern network security principles and concepts like NWDAF. | 5 | This describes a complex monitoring and response system, including the detection model, priority, and a multi-stage escalation policy. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, well-structured, and provides specific, actionable parameters. | 5 | This describes the deployment of a new monitoring capability, fitting the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the monitoring method, the anomaly detection algorithm, the escalation policy, and the overall goal. | 5 | The use of an anomaly detection model, high priority, and rapid escalation policies are all consistent with a security monitoring goal. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the what, how, and why of the security monitoring setup. | 4.9 | An excellent, detailed intent for deploying an advanced, ML-based security monitoring system. |

| 16 | Deployment Intent | Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 429.13ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics. | 5 | The specified parameters (GBR, PDB, priority) are standard 5G QoS characteristics defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. | 4 | This is another QoS-based service deployment, but the parameters (low bitrate, high delay) suggest a specific use case, like some forms of critical IoT, making it moderately complex to provision correctly. | 4 | The description is well-structured, though the triple use of "mission-critical" is slightly redundant. | 5 | "Launch... network service" is a clear "Deployment Intent." | 5 | The intent logically defines a network service by its priority, QoS parameters, and target application type. | 4 | The combination of "critical priority" with a relatively high delay budget (429.13ms) is unusual but not strictly contradictory; it could be for a reliable but not latency-sensitive critical application. | 5 | The intent provides a complete set of QoS parameters for defining the service. | 4.6 | A good, detailed intent for a specific type of critical network service, highlighting the flexibility of 5G QoS. |
| 17 | Deployment Intent | Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1575Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 17.87ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics. | 5 | The specified parameters (Guaranteed Bit Rate, Packet Delay Budget) are standard 5G QoS Flow characteristics defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. | 5 | This intent describes a very high-performance service with demanding bitrate and latency requirements, making it complex to guarantee and deploy. | 4 | Well-structured and clear, although the repeated use of "mission-critical" is slightly verbose. | 5 | "Launch... network service" is a clear "Deployment Intent." | 5 | The intent provides a coherent definition of a network service based on its performance characteristics. | 5 | The high GBR, low PDB, and critical priority are all consistent with a demanding, high-performance application. | 5 | The intent provides a complete definition of the QoS characteristics for the new service. | 4.9 | An excellent, specific, and demanding deployment intent for a high-performance network service. |

| 22 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 200ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | While "response time" is a general KPI, the use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the vision for zero-touch network automation (e.g., in ETSI ZSM). | 4 | The intent is complex as it involves not just a target but also the implementation of advanced capabilities (predictive analytics, automated remediation). | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and describes a well-defined goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The goal of "Optimize performance achieving..." is a perfect example of a "Performance Assurance Intent." | 5 | The intent logically links the performance target (response time) with the advanced methods to achieve and maintain it. | 5 | "High-priority" is consistent with the need for predictive analytics and automated remediation to maintain a performance target. | 4 | The intent is good but lacks context on which application or service the "200ms response time" applies to. | 4.6 | A very good, forward-looking intent that reflects the goals of modern, automated network operations. |

| 24 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 718ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This is similar to a previous intent, aligning with automated network management concepts (ETSI ZSM). The "mission-critical" aspect highlights the importance of the assurance mechanism itself. | 4 | The intent is complex due to its requirement for implementing predictive analytics and automated remediation, which are non-trivial systems. | 5 | The intent is clear, well-structured, and defines a specific performance goal and the methods to achieve it. | 5 | The objective to "Optimize performance achieving..." a specific target is a clear "Performance Assurance Intent." | 5 | The intent logically connects the performance goal (response time) with the advanced, mission-critical capabilities needed to assure it. | 5 | The "mission-critical" qualifier for the analytics and remediation capabilities is consistent with the goal of assuring a specific performance level. | 4 | The intent is very good but could be improved by specifying which service or application this response time target applies to. | 4.6 | A strong intent that captures the essence of modern, AI-driven performance assurance. |
| 25 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 19hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method in 5G (TS 33.501), and 128-NEA2 is a 5G encryption algorithm.

| 27 | Performance Assurance Intent | Configure 179ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.005714 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms. | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate are standard 5G QoS parameters (TS 23.501). Using traffic engineering to meet these is a standard approach. | 4 | This involves configuring multiple precise QoS parameters and implies the implementation of advanced network control mechanisms to guarantee them. | 5 | The intent is technically precise, uses standard terminology correctly, and is easy to understand. | 5 | The intent's goal is to "Configure" specific performance targets, which falls directly under "Performance Assurance." | 5 | The intent logically connects the specific QoS parameter settings to the broader mechanisms needed to enforce them. | 5 | The specified delay and error rate, combined with the "mission-critical" qualifier, are consistent with a reliable service requirement. | 4 | The intent is specific about QoS but vague about the "sophisticated traffic engineering" mechanisms. | 4.7 | A strong and standards-aligned intent for configuring and assuring network performance. |
| 28 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Simulated_Annealing intelligent insights with mission-critical 361days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | Using AI/ML for "intelligent insights" is conceptually aligned with NWDAF, but "Simulated Annealing" is an optimization algorithm, not typically used for generating alerts or insights directly. This suggests a slight misuse of the term. | 5 | The intent describes a highly complex notification system involving a specific algorithm, fault tolerance, long-term historical analysis, and trend-based logic. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the use of "Simulated_Annealing" in this context might be confusing to a domain expert. | 5 | "Alert using..." is a clear "Regular Notification Request." | 3 | The coherence is weak. Simulated Annealing is not a natural fit for generating "insights" or "trend-based notifications"; models like LSTM or Prophet would be more coherent. | 4 | The parameters are internally consistent (long-term analysis for trends), but the choice of algorithm is questionable. | 4 | The intent is specific about the parameters but lacks clarity on what specific events or trends should trigger the alert. | 4.0 | An ambitious but conceptually flawed intent due to the questionable choice of the specified algorithm for this task. |
| 29 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with high-priority 8hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the standard 5G authentication protocol, and 128-NEA3 is a 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). Alerting on such events is a critical security function. | 4 | This is a moderately complex alert, specifying multiple triggers, a high priority, and a related event context. | 4 | The phrasing is mostly clear, though the role of the "key rotation event notifications" part could be slightly more explicit. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly defines the intent as a "Regular Notification Request." | 4 | The components are all related to 5G security, making the intent coherent, but the syntax could be improved for clarity. | 5 | The specified security protocols and high priority are consistent with a critical security alert. | 4 | The intent is good but could be more complete by specifying the notification channel (e.g., email, SMS, API). | 4.4 | A good, standards-aligned security alert request that correctly identifies critical 5G events. |

"Deterministic performance" usually implies very low and stable latency (e.g., single-digit ms). A target of 585ms is inconsistent with this goal. | 4 | The intent is good but lacks context on which service or application this response time target applies to. | 4.3 | A well-formed intent that is logically flawed by pairing the goal of "deterministic performance" with a very high response time target. |
| 163 | Deployment Intent | Monitor security events using fault-tolerant Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with mission-critical 2minutes/9minutes/12minutes escalation policies, ensuring rapid response to security incidents. | 4 | While Isolation Forest is a specific ML algorithm, not a 3GPP standard, using anomaly detection for security monitoring is aligned with modern network security principles and concepts like NWDAF. | 5 | This describes a complex monitoring and response system, including the detection model, fault tolerance, priority, and a multi-stage escalation policy. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, well-structured, and provides specific, actionable parameters. | 5 | This describes the deployment of a new monitoring capability, fitting the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the monitoring method, the anomaly detection algorithm, the escalation policy, and the overall goal. | 5 | The use of an anomaly detection model, fault tolerance, and mission-critical escalation policies are all consistent with a security monitoring goal. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the what, how, and why of the security monitoring setup. | 4.9 | An excellent, detailed intent for deploying an advanced, ML-based security monitoring system. |

| 165 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 135days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | Using AI/ML for "intelligent insights" is conceptually aligned with NWDAF, but "Genetic Algorithm" is an optimization algorithm, not typically used for generating alerts or insights directly. This suggests a misuse of the term. | 5 | The intent describes a highly complex notification system involving a specific algorithm, fault tolerance, long-term historical analysis, and trend-based logic. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the use of "Genetic_Algorithm" in this context is unconventional and may be confusing. | 5 | "Alert using..." is a clear "Regular Notification Request." | 3 | The coherence is weak. Genetic Algorithms are not a natural fit for generating "insights" or "trend-based notifications." Other ML models would be more coherent. | 4 | The parameters are internally consistent, but the choice of algorithm is questionable for this application. | 4 | The intent is specific about the parameters but lacks clarity on what specific events or trends should trigger the alert. | 4.0 | An ambitious but conceptually flawed intent due to the questionable choice of the specified algorithm for this task. |
