| 1 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | The term `256_NEA1` is incorrect and contradictory. 3GPP TS 33.501 specifies NEA1 as a 128-bit algorithm. Certificate-based authentication is a valid concept. | 3 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (authentication failure, security breach), an algorithm, and a related security event (key rotation), adding moderate complexity. | 4 | The sentence structure is clear, but the non-standard technical term `256_NEA1` impairs perfect readability. | 5 | The description clearly defines conditions for an alert, which perfectly matches the "Regular Notification Request" intent type. | 3 | The components are security-related, but linking breach alerts with "key rotation event notifications" is slightly ambiguous in its phrasing. | 2 | The use of `256_NEA1` is internally inconsistent, as NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, creating a technical contradiction. | 3 | It specifies triggers but lacks details on thresholds or the specific content of the notification. | 3.1 | A relevant intent for security monitoring that is significantly flawed by an incorrect and inconsistent security algorithm identifier. |
| 2 | Deployment Intent | "Provision edge computing resources featuring 1 processing cores and 4GB memory allocation, optimized for distributed computing workloads and real-time data analytics." | 3 | This describes infrastructure provisioning, which is foundational for 5G NFs but does not use 3GPP service-level terminology. It's a valid infrastructure intent. | 2 | The intent is a straightforward resource allocation request (CPU cores, memory), making it relatively simple. | 5 | The description is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and easy to parse for both humans and automation systems. | 5 | The description to "Provision... resources" is a direct and perfect match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | All elements (edge computing, cores, memory, workloads) are logically connected and describe a coherent scenario. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions in the resource specifications or their intended use. | 3 | It specifies CPU and memory, but a complete provisioning request would ideally include storage and networking details. | 4.0 | A clear, readable, and coherent infrastructure deployment intent, though it operates at a resource level rather than a 3GPP service level. |
| 3 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 396GB DDR5 memory and 5160GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 3 | The intent focuses on hardware specs (`DDR5`, `SATA_SSD`), which are practical but not defined by 3GPP standards. The feasibility check process itself is a valid operational concept. | 3 | It specifies exact hardware types and sizes and requests a "performance impact analysis," which is a non-trivial task. | 5 | The language is precise, unambiguous, and clearly states the objective of the evaluation. | 5 | The request to "Evaluate" requirements and their impact directly aligns with the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The request to check specific hardware requirements along with a performance analysis is highly logical and coherent. | 5 | The specified hardware values and the requested analysis are consistent and present no contradictions. | 5 | The intent clearly defines what to evaluate (memory, storage) and the success criteria (performance impact), making it a complete request. | 4.4 | An excellent, well-formed intent for assessing infrastructure feasibility. It is practical, clear, and complete for its purpose. |
| 4 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 13 processing cores and 505GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 3 | The intent describes resource scaling, a valid operational task, but uses generic compute terms rather than 3GPP-specific NF or service parameters. | 3 | It combines resource modification (cores, memory) with a performance constraint (timeout) and a high-level goal, adding layers of complexity. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated, with specific values and constraints that are easy to understand. | 5 | The description to "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and accurate reflection of a "Modification Intent". | 5 | The components—adjusting resources, setting a timeout, and optimizing for performance/cost—are logically interconnected. | 5 | The goal of optimizing performance by adjusting resources is consistent and logical. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying the target application or network function being modified. | 4.3 | A very clear and practical intent for modifying compute resources with well-defined parameters and goals. |
| 5 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network performance using LSTM_Autoencoder behavioral anomaly detection with Neural_Network predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. [Instance-4805-9975]" | 4 | Aligns with 3GPP NWDAF concepts (TS 23.288) for network analytics. The specific ML models (`LSTM_Autoencoder`) are implementation details but are contextually appropriate. | 5 | This intent specifies sophisticated technical methods (a specific type of autoencoder, neural networks) for a complex task (proactive performance management). | 4 | The language is technical but clear to a subject matter expert. The use of underscores is consistent for technical terms. | 5 | The description to "Monitor network performance" for "proactive performance management" perfectly aligns with the "Performance Assurance Intent" type. | 5 | Using anomaly detection and predictive analytics for performance management is a coherent and logical strategy. | 5 | There are no contradictions between the stated methods and the intended goal. | 4 | It specifies the 'how' (ML models) but not the 'what' (which specific KPIs to monitor), which would make it more complete. | 4.6 | A strong, technically detailed intent for performance assurance that correctly references modern analytics concepts relevant to 5G networks. |
| 6 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 10hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | All terms are standard. `Certificate_Based` authentication, `128_NEA3` (ZUC algorithm), and key rotation are valid 5G security concepts (TS 33.501). | 3 | Specifies multiple conditions and security parameters, making it moderately complex. | 4 | The sentence is clear and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The description clearly defines conditions for an alert, perfectly matching the "Regular Notification Request" intent. | 3 | Linking breach alerts directly with "key rotation event notifications" is slightly awkward; it's unclear if these are two separate notification triggers. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are all valid and consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent is clear on the triggers but lacks detail on notification targets or severity levels. | 4.0 | A good and standards-aligned security notification intent, though the phrasing connecting the different event types could be slightly clearer. |
| 7 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 231ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | This aligns with the closed-loop automation principles in 5G management (e.g., as part of the Network Data Analytics Function, NWDAF). | 3 | It defines a specific performance target (response time) and mentions advanced methods (predictive analytics, remediation), giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and defines a measurable outcome. | 5 | The description to "Optimize performance achieving" a specific metric is a direct match for a "Performance Assurance Intent". | 5 | The combination of a target metric, predictive analytics, and automated remediation forms a very coherent strategy. | 5 | The elements are all consistent and work towards the common goal of performance optimization. | 4 | The intent is good but could be more complete by specifying the service or application to which this response time applies. | 4.4 | An excellent, outcome-based intent that clearly specifies the desired performance goal and the high-level methods to achieve it. |
| 8 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent enhanced mobile broadband with high-priority high-high-throughput data services monitoring with high-priority Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. [Instance-4808-0] | 4 | eMBB is a standard 5G use case (TS 22.261). Using anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest) for monitoring aligns with NWDAF principles (TS 23.288). | 5 | This is a complex request involving configuration of a service type (eMBB), monitoring specific qualities, and applying a specific ML algorithm for proactive alerting. | 4 | The sentence is long and dense with technical terms, but it is well-structured and understandable for a technical audience. | 5 | The request to configure monitoring and proactive alerting is a perfect fit for a "Regular Notification Request" intent. | 5 | All parts of the intent—eMBB service, high-throughput monitoring, anomaly detection, and alerting—form a coherent, end-to-end monitoring strategy. | 5 | There are no contradictions. The use of high-priority flags for different components is consistent. | 5 | This intent is very complete, specifying the service, the goal, the method, and the trigger for the notification. | 4.7 | A comprehensive and well-defined intent for proactive performance monitoring of a specific 5G service slice, using relevant and modern concepts. |
| 9 | Deployment Intent | "Provision edge computing resources featuring 5 processing cores and 28GB memory allocation, optimized for distributed computing workloads and real-time data analytics." | 3 | This is an infrastructure-level intent. While necessary for 5G, it uses generic compute terms, not 3GPP-specific service or function definitions. | 2 | It's a simple resource allocation request, specifying only CPU cores and memory. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and uses standard, easily understandable language. | 5 | "Provision... resources" is a direct and unambiguous match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The specified resources and their intended use for edge computing and data analytics are logically connected. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions in the request. | 3 | The intent specifies cores and memory but lacks storage or networking details, which are typically required for provisioning. | 4.0 | A clear and straightforward infrastructure deployment intent, effective for its purpose but lacking 3GPP-specific context. |
| 10 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 15hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | All terms are valid according to 3GPP TS 33.501. `Certificate_Based` authentication and `128_NEA1` (AES) are standard security mechanisms. | 3 | The intent defines multiple triggers, includes a priority level, and specifies security parameters, giving it moderate complexity. | 4 | The sentence structure is clear and the terminology is standard. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" specific events perfectly aligns with the "Regular Notification Request" intent type. | 3 | The phrasing linking breach alerts with "key rotation event notifications" is somewhat ambiguous, as in previous similar examples. | 5 | The specified security concepts are all valid and consistent with a secure 5G environment. | 3 | While triggers are defined, the intent could be improved by specifying notification channels or recipients. | 4.0 | A solid and standards-compliant security notification intent, with only a minor ambiguity in the phrasing of the event triggers. |
| 11 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 96 ARM64 processing cores at 2.16GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This intent correctly references a core 5G Network Function (AMF, Access and Mobility Management Function, per TS 23.501) and relevant deployment parameters. | 4 | It involves assessing a specific NF (AMF) against detailed hardware specs (cores, architecture, clock speed) and high-level constraints, making it quite complex. | 5 | The language is precise, technical, and clearly outlines the scope of the feasibility assessment. | 5 | The request to "Assess... feasibility" is a direct and perfect match for the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | Linking the feasibility of an AMF deployment to specific CPU resources and performance constraints is a coherent and practical approach. | 5 | There are no contradictions. The "mission-critical" tag aligns well with assessing a key control plane function like AMF. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF, the resources to check, and the criteria for the assessment (computational/performance). | 4.9 | An excellent, specific, and technically sound intent for assessing the deployment feasibility of a critical 5G network function. |
| 12 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade UPF network function using Samsung SW_1.7.106 software on high-performance 1-core x86_64 architecture with 8GB DDR4 memory and 215GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | Correctly identifies a key 5G NF (UPF, User Plane Function) and uses plausible, though non-standardized, details like software versions and hardware specs. | 5 | This is a highly detailed deployment intent, specifying the NF, vendor software, CPU architecture, core count, memory, and storage type/size. | 5 | The description is very clear, well-organized, and contains all necessary details for an automated deployment system. | 5 | The instruction to "Deploy... UPF network function" is a perfect match for the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | All specified components (UPF, Samsung software, x86 architecture, memory/storage) form a completely coherent deployment package. | 5 | The resource specifications are specific and consistent with deploying a lightweight network function instance. | 5 | This intent is very complete, providing a full manifest of software and hardware requirements for deployment. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a detailed, actionable, and complete deployment intent for a specific 5G network function. |
| 13 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy intelligent edge ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications infrastructure with high-priority DISTRIBUTED deployment strategy supporting 457715_devices_per_km2 device connectivity density, enabling ultra-low ultra-low latency applications and local data processing." | 4 | The terminology is slightly excessive ("ultra-ultra-reliable," "low-ultra-low latency"), but it correctly references URLLC, a key 5G service category (TS 22.261). Device density is a valid parameter. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, defining a service type (URLLC), deployment strategy (distributed), a specific performance metric (device density), and enabling goals. | 3 | The repetitive use of "ultra" harms readability and makes the intent sound hyperbolic rather than technical. Otherwise, it is structured logically. | 5 | The instruction to "Deploy... infrastructure" clearly aligns with the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | All the concepts—edge, URLLC, distributed deployment, high device density, and local processing—are coherently linked to support mission-critical applications. | 4 | While coherent, the exaggerated qualifiers ("ultra-ultra") are inconsistent with standard technical language. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the what (URLLC infrastructure), where (edge), how (distributed), and for what purpose (high density, low latency apps). | 4.4 | A strong, comprehensive intent for deploying a URLLC service, though its readability is slightly impacted by exaggerated, non-standard terminology. |
| 14 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 91 core utilization and 4GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF network function. Requesting performance reports on resource utilization (CPU, memory) is a standard operational task. | 4 | The request is complex, asking not just for a report on metrics but also for "detailed resource optimization recommendations," which requires an analysis step. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased, specific, and easy to understand. | 5 | The request to "Generate comprehensive... report" is a perfect match for the "Intent Report Request" type. | 5 | The components—reporting on AMF performance, analyzing CPU/memory, and providing optimization recommendations—are logically sequential and coherent. | 5 | The specified resource values (91 cores, 4GB memory) are plausible and do not contradict the nature of the request. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, the type of analysis, and the desired output (recommendations). | 4.9 | An excellent example of a clear, actionable, and complete intent for generating a performance and optimization report. |
| 15 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 83 processing cores and 240GB memory allocation with high-priority 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 3 | This is a generic resource modification intent, not specific to 3GPP standards. The concepts are relevant to the underlying infrastructure. | 3 | It modifies multiple resource parameters (cores, memory) and adds a performance constraint (timeout), giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The description is clear, precise, and easy for an orchestration system to parse. | 5 | The instruction to "Adjust compute resources" directly corresponds to the "Modification Intent" type. | 5 | The act of adjusting resources under a timeout constraint to achieve a performance/cost balance is a coherent optimization strategy. | 5 | The specified values and goals are internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified which network function or service is being adjusted. | 4.3 | A clear and well-formed intent for infrastructure resource modification, with specific parameters and a clear high-level goal. |
| 16 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-4816-37] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard performance indicators (KPIs) for 5G services like eMBB and URLLC. The values are representative. | 3 | The intent defines a notification based on two distinct performance metric thresholds (throughput, latency) and specifies a follow-up action (escalation). | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and uses standard performance metric terminology. It is easily parsable. | 5 | The request to "Alert when" specific conditions are met is a perfect example of a "Regular Notification Request". | 5 | The two conditions (low throughput, high latency) are common indicators of performance degradation and are coherent triggers for a single alert policy. | 5 | The specified performance values are consistent with high-performance network service goals. | 4 | The intent is good but could be improved by defining the specific thresholds and limits numerically. | 4.4 | An excellent, practical intent for performance monitoring and alerting, clearly stating the trigger conditions and desired action. |
| 17 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 19 core utilization and 301GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF network function and standard performance metrics (CPU/memory utilization). | 4 | This request is for more than just data; it asks for an analytical output ("optimization recommendations"), making it complex. | 5 | The intent is very clearly phrased, with specific metrics and a well-defined output requirement. | 5 | "Generate comprehensive... report" is a direct and accurate description of an "Intent Report Request". | 5 | Requesting a report on resource consumption to generate optimization recommendations is a logical and coherent workflow. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions in the request. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF (AMF), the metrics, the goal, and the desired output format (recommendations). | 4.9 | A well-structured and complete intent that clearly specifies the need for a detailed performance report with actionable recommendations. |
| 18 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize deterministic performance achieving 617ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Deterministic performance is a key concept for certain 5G services. Using analytics and remediation aligns with 3GPP management frameworks like NWDAF. | 3 | It specifies a target metric (response time) and high-level methods (analytics, remediation), giving it moderate complexity. | 5 | The intent is stated clearly, with a measurable goal that is easy to understand. | 5 | The goal to "Optimize... performance achieving" a specific metric is a perfect fit for a "Performance Assurance Intent". | 5 | The combination of a deterministic performance goal, predictive analytics, and automated remediation forms a coherent closed-loop automation strategy. | 4 | The response time of 617ms is quite high for something described as "deterministic performance," which usually implies much lower latencies. This is a minor inconsistency. | 4 | The intent could be more complete by specifying the application or service requiring this level of performance. | 4.3 | A strong, outcome-based intent for performance assurance, with a minor inconsistency in the specified response time value for a deterministic service. |
| 19 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication frameworks and 128_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-4819-56] | 5 | Correctly references standard 5G security mechanisms: EAP-AKA' (TS 33.501) and 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G encryption, TS 33.501). | 4 | This intent combines security requirements (authentication, encryption) with a high-level performance constraint ("without compromising performance"), making it complex. | 5 | The language is technical but very clear, accurately using standard security terminology. | 5 | The description to "Secure... infrastructure" while ensuring performance aligns perfectly with a "Performance Assurance Intent". | 5 | Combining specific security protocols with a performance assurance constraint is a coherent and crucial requirement in network design. | 5 | There are no contradictions; the selected security protocols are standard and their performance impact is a valid consideration. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating the security mechanisms to be used and the overarching performance goal. | 4.9 | An excellent intent that correctly and coherently combines specific 3GPP security requirements with a practical performance assurance goal. |

| 21 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 30 processing cores and 410GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 3 | The intent mixes generic infrastructure terms (cores, memory) with a high-level network goal ("transport network optimization"). "Core network" is vague here. | 4 | It combines specific resource allocation changes with a broad, complex goal (transport network optimization), which requires significant underlying logic. | 4 | The phrasing is a bit disjointed, connecting specific compute numbers directly to a broad network optimization goal. | 5 | The request to "Modify" resources clearly aligns with the "Modification Intent" type. | 3 | It's not fully coherent how changing CPU/memory for the "core network" directly achieves "transport network optimization" without more context. The link is weak. | 4 | There's no direct contradiction, but the relationship between the parameters is not strongly established. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It's unclear which specific NF(s) in the core network are being modified. | 3.7 | A somewhat vague modification intent that combines specific resource changes with a high-level goal without clearly linking the two. |
| 22 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | All security terms are valid and aligned with 3GPP TS 33.501 (Certificate-Based auth, 128-NEA3 for ZUC encryption). | 3 | The intent specifies multiple triggers and security parameters, giving it moderate complexity. | 4 | The description is clear and uses standard terminology correctly. | 5 | The instruction to "Alert on" specific events is a direct match for the "Regular Notification Request" intent type. | 3 | As in previous examples, the phrasing that links breach alerts with "key rotation event notifications" is slightly ambiguous. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are all valid and consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent specifies triggers but could be more complete by detailing the notification destination or severity. | 4.0 | A good, standards-compliant security notification intent. Its only weakness is a recurring minor ambiguity in the phrasing of the triggers. |
| 23 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 2 | Contains the incorrect and contradictory term `256_NEA1`. 3GPP TS 33.501 defines NEA1 as a 128-bit algorithm. | 3 | Defines multiple triggers for an alert, involving specific (though incorrect) security parameters. | 4 | The sentence is well-structured, but the incorrect technical term harms its clarity and correctness. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" specific conditions is a perfect match for the "Regular Notification Request" type. | 3 | The structure is coherent, but the flawed technical term disrupts the logic. | 2 | The term `256_NEA1` is internally inconsistent, creating a direct contradiction. | 3 | The intent is clear about the triggers but lacks detail on the notification's content or destination. | 3.1 | Similar to record #1, this intent is relevant but is critically flawed by the use of a non-standard and inconsistent security algorithm identifier. |
| 24 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 128_NEA3 encryption with 17hours automated key management. | 5 | All specified mechanisms are standard 5G security concepts found in 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security policies (authentication, encryption, key management) into a single assurance goal. | 5 | The language is clear, technical, and precise. | 5 | The description to "Secure performance assurance" is a direct match for the "Performance Assurance Intent" type. | 5 | The combination of authentication, encryption, and automated key management forms a coherent and robust security posture. | 5 | The elements are consistent with each other and with the goal of securing the network. | 5 | The intent completely specifies the core components of the desired security policy. | 4.9 | An excellent intent that clearly and correctly specifies a coherent set of 3GPP-aligned security policies to achieve performance assurance. |
| 25 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 85 processing cores and 426GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 3 | This is an infrastructure-level modification, using generic terms for compute resources rather than 3GPP-specific parameters. | 4 | It involves modifying multiple resource parameters, adding a performance constraint (timeout), and targeting a high-level goal ("deterministic performance"). | 5 | The description is clear, detailed, and easy to parse, with specific values for all parameters. | 5 | The instruction to "Adjust compute resources" is a direct fit for the "Modification Intent" type. | 5 | The components—adjusting resources, setting a timeout, and optimizing for deterministic performance and cost—are logically interconnected. | 5 | The specified parameters and goals are consistent and work together toward a clear objective. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could be improved by naming the application or NF being modified. | 4.4 | A very clear, specific, and practical intent for modifying infrastructure resources to meet performance and cost objectives. |
| 26 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure deterministic performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 128_NEA3 encryption with high-priority 5hours automated key management. | 5 | All terms are standard and correct per 3GPP TS 33.501. 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method, and 128-NEA3 (ZUC) is a valid encryption algorithm. | 4 | This intent specifies a complete security profile, including authentication, encryption, and key management policy with a priority level. | 5 | The language is precise, using standard 3GPP security terminology correctly. | 5 | "Secure deterministic performance assurance" is a perfect description for a "Performance Assurance Intent". | 5 | The combination of 5G-AKA, a strong encryption algorithm, and rapid automated key rotation forms a very coherent high-security strategy. | 5 | All the specified security mechanisms are consistent with a high-priority, secure service. | 5 | The intent clearly and completely specifies the desired security posture for the service. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that defines a complete and coherent security policy for assuring deterministic performance. |
| 27 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 24 RISC_V processing cores at 3.1GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF Network Function. Using a specific architecture (RISC-V) and performance type ("deterministic") is a valid, practical consideration. | 4 | This is a complex feasibility check, requiring analysis of a specific NF on a non-traditional CPU architecture against stringent performance constraints. | 5 | The language is technical, precise, and clearly specifies all parameters for the assessment. | 5 | The request to "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | It is highly coherent to assess the feasibility of deploying a critical NF like AMF on a specific hardware platform (RISC-V) for a deterministic use case. | 5 | There are no contradictions. The "mission-critical" and "deterministic" tags align well with the need for a thorough feasibility check. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF, the hardware, and the criteria for evaluation. | 4.9 | An excellent, highly specific, and technically relevant intent for assessing the feasibility of deploying a core 5G function on an emerging hardware platform. |
| 28 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with mission-critical 7 x86_64 cores and 7GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 3 | This is an infrastructure provisioning intent. It uses generic compute terms, although the context ("demanding network functions") points to a 5G environment. | 2 | It's a simple resource request, specifying only core count, architecture, and memory. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The instruction to "Provision... compute resources" directly aligns with the "Deployment Intent" type. | 5 | The specification of high-performance resources (DDR5) for demanding NFs is logically coherent. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which "demanding network functions" the resources are for, nor does it mention storage. | 4.0 | A clear and simple infrastructure provisioning intent, suitable for allocating resources but lacking 3GPP-specific details. |
| 29 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-4829-103] | 4 | Throughput and latency are key performance indicators for 5G services. The specified values are representative of high-performance goals. | 3 | The intent defines a notification based on two distinct performance thresholds (throughput and latency) and includes a follow-up action. | 5 | The language is very clear, precise, and easy to parse. It uses standard terminology for performance metrics. | 5 | The request to "Alert when" specific performance criteria are not met is a perfect example of a "Regular Notification Request". | 5 | Triggering an alert on either low throughput or high latency are coherent conditions for monitoring a high-performance service. | 5 | The performance targets are consistent with each other for a high-quality service. | 4 | The intent is good, but does not specify the exact numerical "thresholds" or "limits", leaving some ambiguity. | 4.4 | An excellent and practical intent for performance monitoring alerts, clearly stating the conditions and desired response. |
| 30 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous performance optimization using fault-tolerant lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism machine learning models with mission-critical 85.56% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 4 | This aligns with the goals of zero-touch management and NWDAF (TS 23.288). The specific model name is an implementation detail but contextually valid. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying an autonomous action, a fault-tolerant requirement, a very specific ML model type, and a target prediction accuracy. | 4 | The language is very technical and specific, readable by a data scientist or ML engineer.
