The request to evaluate requirements and analyze performance impact is a valid engineering task. | 3 | The intent specifies resource amounts and types, but the phrasing "Evaluate memory and storage requirements for..." is slightly circular. It seems to be asking to validate if the given amounts are feasible. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, though the wording could be improved to "Evaluate feasibility of a deployment with..." for better clarity. | 5 | The core request to "Evaluate... requirements" and "performance impact analysis" aligns well with a `Intent Feasibility Check`. | 5 | It logically connects specific hardware resources to the need for a performance impact analysis, which is a coherent request. | 5 | The specified values for memory and storage are large but consistent with a high-performance, mission-critical application. | 4 | The intent specifies the resources to be evaluated but doesn't mention the workload or NF, which is a critical piece of missing information. | 4.3 | A good feasibility check intent that is specific about resources but could be improved with better phrasing and by identifying the target workload. |
| 14 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 23hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is standard. `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP algorithm identifier, though 5G algorithms can use 256-bit keys.

The focus on maximum bitrate is a valid QoS parameter modification. | 4 | Modifying QoS configurations, especially for high-bitrate, automation-related flows, is a complex task that can have significant network-wide impact. | 5 | The intent is highly readable, using precise, standard terminology in a well-structured sentence. | 5 | The action "Update... configuration" is a clear example of a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the modification of a specific QoS flow with a target bitrate and the overall goal of enhancing traffic handling. | 5 | The specified 5QI value and the high bitrate are consistent with the "Large Packets" descriptor and industrial automation use cases. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the exact QoS flow to modify, the parameter to change (maximum bitrate), and the target value. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that clearly and completely specifies a critical QoS modification. |
| 16 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy sophisticated HMAC_SHA512 key derivation functions utilizing 256_bit cryptographic keys with high-priority automated 6hours rotation intervals, ensuring continuous security posture and cryptographic freshness." | 4 | HMAC-SHA512 is a standard cryptographic function. While not a standalone network function itself, it's a component that would be deployed as part of a security infrastructure (e.g., within a UDM/AUSF). | 4 | The intent describes the deployment of a specific, advanced security mechanism with automated policies (key rotation), which is a complex operational task. | 5 | The intent is well-written, clear, and uses precise cryptographic terminology. | 4 | While it describes deploying a capability, it's more of a security policy configuration than a full network function deployment. However, it's a reasonable fit. | 5 | The intent logically connects the cryptographic function, key properties, and rotation policy to the overall goal of ensuring security posture. | 5 | The parameters are consistent: HMAC-SHA512 is a strong algorithm, and frequent key rotation is a best practice for maintaining cryptographic freshness. | 4 | It clearly defines the security mechanism to be deployed but lacks context on where or in which network function it should be applied. | 4.4 | A clear and technically sound intent for deploying a security capability, though it could benefit from more context about its placement in the network architecture. |
| 17 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 5 x86_64 processing cores at 1.85GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies a standard 5G NF (AMF) and uses standard terms for compute resources (x86_64, cores, GHz). The assessment goal is valid. | 3 | This is a straightforward feasibility check focusing on basic CPU parameters for a single NF, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and uses standard technical terms, ensuring high readability. | 5 | The description to "Assess... feasibility" is a direct and accurate match for the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the target NF (AMF) with the hardware resources to be evaluated and the criteria for evaluation (computational requirements). | 5 | The specified parameters (5 x86_64 cores at 1.85GHz) are internally consistent for a small-to-medium AMF instance. | 3 | The check is incomplete as it omits essential resources like memory, storage, and network I/O, which are critical for AMF feasibility. | 4.4 | A clear and relevant feasibility check, but its practical value is limited by the lack of memory and other resource specifications. |
| 18 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 64 processing cores and 459GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | The intent correctly identifies core network resource allocation (CPU, memory) as a modifiable parameter. "Transport network optimization" is a valid but very high-level concept. | 4 | This intent is complex as it links modifications in two different domains: core network compute resources and transport network optimization, implying a cross-domain operation. | 3 | The phrase "with transport network optimization" is vague. It's unclear if this is a goal, a constraint, or a concurrent action, which reduces readability. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify core network... allocation," clearly aligns with the `Modification Intent` type. | 3 | The connection between modifying compute resources and optimizing the transport network is logical but not well-defined, lacking coherence. | 4 | The specified compute resources are plausible. The link to transport optimization is not contradictory, just underspecified. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It doesn't state which core network function's resources are being modified, and the transport optimization part is too vague to be actionable. | 3.6 | While the intent addresses a relevant cross-domain modification, its vagueness and incompleteness make it difficult to interpret and act upon. |

The instance ID is a plus. | 5 | The request to "Alert when..." fits the `Regular Notification Request` type perfectly. | 5 | The intent coherently defines a performance monitoring policy with clear triggers and a logical consequence (escalation). | 5 | The specified values (1000Mbps throughput, 5ms latency) represent a high-performance service level and are consistent with each other. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could be improved by specifying the network slice, service, or interface to which these thresholds apply. | 4.7 | An excellent example of a performance-based notification intent. It is clear, actionable, and technically sound. |

| 21 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with 19hours automated key management. | 4 | `EAP-TLS` is a standard authentication protocol. `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP identifier, which is a minor inaccuracy. Automated key management is a valid concept. | 4 | This intent combines three distinct security functions (authentication, encryption, key management) into a single performance assurance policy, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The language is clear, and the intent structure logically lists the security mechanisms to be used for assurance. | 5 | The goal of "Secure performance assurance" aligns perfectly with the `Performance Assurance Intent` type. | 5 | The intent coherently groups authentication, encryption, and key management as components of a comprehensive security assurance strategy. | 4 | The use of the non-standard term `256_NEA1` is a minor inconsistency. The other parameters are consistent. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the security methods but does not define the performance characteristics to be assured (e.g., latency, throughput). | 4.4 | A strong intent for security assurance, though it contains a minor terminological inaccuracy and lacks specific performance targets. |
| 22 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 88Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | `4T4R` MIMO, `Horizontal_Beamforming`, and backhaul capacity are all standard and correct terms related to RAN technology. | 4 | The intent describes a multi-faceted modification to an antenna system, including beamforming and backhaul, indicating a reasonably complex task. | 5 | The intent is clearly structured, uses precise terminology, and is easy to understand for a network engineer. | 5 | The action "Reconfigure" makes this a clear and appropriate `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent logically connects the antenna system, beamforming type, and backhaul upgrade to the high-level goals of improving coverage and performance. | 5 | A very high backhaul capacity of 88Gbps might be overkill for a `4T4R` system but is not technically contradictory, just potentially inefficient. | 5 | It's a complete modification request, specifying the target, the actions to perform, and the desired capacity enhancement. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and technically sound intent for RAN modification, with a slight question about the sizing consistency. |
| 23 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | `5G-AKA` (TS 33.501) and `128-NEA2` (AES-based encryption) are both standard 5G security mechanisms. The intent is fully aligned with 3GPP specifications. | 4 | This intent defines a notification rule with multiple triggers related to different security aspects (authentication, confidentiality, key management), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The language is precise, and the structure "Alert on X or Y with Z" is clear and easily parsable. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" events and provide "notifications" is a perfect match for the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 5 | The intent coherently combines monitoring of authentication, encryption, and key lifecycle events into a single security policy. | 5 | All specified mechanisms and timings are internally consistent and reflect a valid security monitoring scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly defining the conditions, priority, and associated event information for the notification. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned security notification intent that is clear, complete, and actionable. |

It lacks context about what service, application, or network segment this response time applies to. | 4.4 | A clear, high-level intent for performance assurance that correctly identifies the goal and methods, but lacks specific context. |
| 26 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 92GB DDR4 memory and 5689GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | The hardware terms (DDR4, NVMe SSD) are standard. The task of evaluating requirements and analyzing performance impact is a valid engineering activity. | 3 | Similar to record 13, the phrasing "Evaluate... requirements for..." is slightly circular. The core task is to assess the feasibility of the given resources for an unstated workload. | 4 | The intent is understandable, but could be phrased more clearly as "Assess the feasibility of deploying a system with...". | 5 | The request to "Evaluate... requirements" and perform "performance impact analysis" fits the `Intent Feasibility Check` category. | 5 | It logically connects the hardware specifications to the need for a performance impact analysis. | 5 | The specified memory and storage values are consistent and plausible for a data-intensive application. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it omits the most critical piece of information: the network function or application workload to be evaluated. | 4.1 | A decent intent for a hardware feasibility study, but it's critically hampered by the lack of information about the target workload. |

| 32 | Deployment Intent | "Launch medium priority network service guaranteeing 132Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 34.72ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | The intent uses standard QoS terminology, including Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB), which are fundamental concepts in 5G QoS (TS 23.501). | 4 | Deploying a network service with guaranteed QoS is a complex task that involves resource reservation and configuration across multiple network domains (RAN, Core, Transport). | 5 | The language is precise and clearly states the service parameters (priority, bitrate, delay) and its purpose. | 5 | The request to "Launch... network service" is a clear and appropriate use of `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the service parameters to its intended use ("supporting mission-critical applications"), providing clear context. | 5 | The specified bitrate and delay budget are consistent with many real-time applications that are mission-critical but not strictly URLLC. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying all the key QoS parameters required to define and launch the service. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that clearly and completely defines the deployment of a QoS-guaranteed network service. |
| 33 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication frameworks and 128_NEA2 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics. | 4 | `EAP-AKA'` (Prime) is a standard authentication protocol. `128-NEA2` (AES) is a standard encryption algorithm. The intent is well-aligned with security standards. The typo "high-priorityout" reduces readability. | 4 | The intent addresses the complex challenge of applying specific, strong security measures while simultaneously assuring that network performance is not negatively impacted. | 3 | The typo "high-priorityout" detracts from readability.

The long sentence makes it slightly less readable than a more concise request. | 5 | The request to "Configure... monitoring with... proactive alerting" is a strong fit for a `Regular Notification Request`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the service type (mMTC), the monitoring technique (ML-based anomaly detection), and the action (alerting) into a single, advanced policy. | 5 | Using an LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection in time-series data from mMTC networks is a technically consistent and valid approach. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the context, the detection method, the model, the trigger condition (degradation), and the action. | 4.9 | An outstanding, forward-looking intent that perfectly captures the use of advanced AI/ML for proactive network monitoring. |

The repetition of "ultra-ultra-reliable" and "mission-critical" is redundant and not standard terminology. | 5 | This describes the deployment of a highly complex and demanding URLLC service, requiring specific network architecture (5G SA) and advanced RAN technology (Massive MIMO). | 3 | The excessive repetition of adjectives ("ultra-ultra-reliable," "mission-critical") makes the sentence cumbersome and reduces readability. | 5 | The primary action, "Execute... deployment," is a clear `Deployment Intent`. | 4 | The intent is coherent but the repetitive phrasing slightly obscures the logical flow. It correctly links URLLC service with the required enabling technologies. | 5 | The components are consistent: URLLC services are best delivered over a 5G SA architecture, and Massive MIMO can help ensure the required reliability and low latency. | 4 | The intent is quite complete in its high-level description of the service and key technologies but lacks specific QoS parameters (e.g., latency budget, reliability target). | 4.3 | A strong intent describing a complex URLLC deployment, but its quality is diminished by poor readability due to excessive repetition. |

| 42 | Deployment Intent | "Launch medium priority network service guaranteeing 185Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 35.66ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | This intent correctly uses standard 5G QoS parameters: Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB), as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. | 4 | Deploying a service with guaranteed QoS is a complex undertaking, requiring resource management and policy enforcement across the network. | 5 | The language is precise, and the intent clearly specifies the key performance parameters of the service. | 5 | The action "Launch... network service" is a clear and appropriate use of `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the technical QoS parameters to the service's purpose ("supporting mission-critical applications"). | 5 | The specified bitrate and delay budget are consistent with applications that require reliable performance but are not as stringent as URLLC. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing all the necessary QoS information (priority, GBR, PDB) to define the service. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that clearly and completely specifies the deployment of a QoS-enabled network service. |
| 43 | Modification Intent | Adjust Massive_MIMO_32T32R radio parameters and Vertical_Beamforming beamforming configuration with mission-critical core network coordination. | 5 | The terms `Massive_MIMO_32T32R` and `Vertical_Beamforming` are standard in 5G RAN. The need for coordination with the core network for such changes is also a valid operational concept. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, as it involves modifying advanced RAN parameters and requires coordination with the core network, implying a cross-domain modification. | 4 | The phrase "with mission-critical core network coordination" is slightly vague on the specific coordination required but the overall intent is clear to a domain expert. | 5 | The action "Adjust... radio parameters and... configuration" is a clear `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the RAN modifications (MIMO, beamforming) with the necessary operational constraint (core network coordination). | 5 | The components are consistent; significant RAN changes often require updates or coordination with core network functions like AMF or SMF. | 4 | The intent is complete in describing the 'what' (adjust MIMO/beamforming) and a key constraint, but could be improved by specifying which radio parameters to adjust. | 4.7 | A strong, technically relevant intent that correctly captures the complexity of cross-domain (RAN-Core) modifications. |
| 44 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 367GB LPDDR5 memory and 1305GB NVMe_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms (LPDDR5, NVMe SSD). The concept of evaluating requirements and impact is valid. The phrasing is slightly awkward. | 3 | The intent is to assess the feasibility of the given resources. The phrasing "Evaluate... requirements for..." is circular. | 4 | The intent is understandable, but the wording could be improved for better clarity (e.g., "Assess feasibility of a system with..."). | 5 | The request to "Evaluate" and perform "performance impact analysis" aligns with the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | It logically connects the hardware resources to the need for a performance analysis. | 5 | The specified memory and storage amounts are large but consistent with a demanding, mission-critical application. | 3 | The intent is critically incomplete as it fails to specify the workload, service, or network function for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.1 | A reasonable intent for a hardware resource evaluation, but its value is severely limited by the omission of the target workload. |
| 45 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 198GB DDR4 memory and 4363GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms (DDR4, Optane storage). The intent to evaluate these for a workload is a valid engineering task. | 3 | The intent is to assess the feasibility of the given resources, but the wording "Evaluate... requirements for..." is slightly confusing. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the phrasing could be more direct, such as "Assess feasibility of a workload using...". | 5 | The core request to "Evaluate" and conduct a "performance impact analysis" fits the `Intent Feasibility Check` category. | 5 | It coherently links the specified hardware components to the required performance analysis. | 5 | The combination of DDR4 RAM and Optane persistent memory is a consistent and modern configuration for high-performance applications. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it does not specify the application or network function that would use these resources, making the evaluation impossible. | 4.1 | A technically plausible hardware evaluation intent that is rendered incomplete by the absence of the target workload. |
| 46 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 7hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | `5G-AKA` is standard. `256_NEA2` is not a standard 3GPP identifier, although `NEA2` (AES) can use a 256-bit key. This is a minor terminological inaccuracy. | 4 | This intent defines a multi-condition notification rule based on several security events (authentication, encryption, key management), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly structured and easy to understand, specifying triggers and associated event information unambiguously. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events and provide "notifications" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically groups various security-related events into a cohesive monitoring and notification policy. | 4 | The use of the non-standard term `256_NEA2` is a minor inconsistency. The other parameters are consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating the conditions that should trigger an alert and what related information to include. | 4.6 | A strong and clear security notification intent, with only a minor deviation from standard 3GPP terminology for the encryption algorithm. |
| 47 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization with genetic algorithms for complex deterministic performance trade-off management. | 4 | A genetic algorithm is a valid optimization technique. Its application to network performance trade-offs is a concept explored in academia and advanced network management, but it's not a standard 3GPP procedure. | 5 | This intent describes a highly complex assurance mechanism, using a specific and advanced AI/ML technique (multi-objective genetic algorithm) to manage performance trade-offs. | 4 | The language is technical and specific. The repetition of "multi-objective" is slightly redundant but the meaning is clear. | 5 | The goal to "Implement... optimization... for... performance trade-off management" is a clear `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links a specific optimization method with the complex problem of managing performance trade-offs. | 5 | The use of a genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization is a consistent and well-established concept in computer science. | 3 | The intent is highly conceptual. It's incomplete because it doesn't specify which performance objectives to trade off (e.g., latency vs. throughput vs. energy efficiency). | 4.4 | A conceptually interesting and complex intent for advanced performance assurance, but it's too abstract to be directly actionable without more detail. |
| 48 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 67 processing cores and 323GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The intent modifies standard compute parameters (cores, memory) and an operational parameter (timeout). The goals of performance and cost efficiency are standard. | 4 | This is a complex modification as it involves balancing three factors: compute resources, a performance constraint (timeout), and a business constraint (cost efficiency). | 5 | The intent is clearly written, specifying the exact resource values and constraints, and stating the desired outcome. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and fitting description for a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the resource adjustment and timeout constraint to the dual goals of optimizing performance and maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | The specified parameters are internally consistent. Adjusting resources and timeouts are common ways to manage performance and cost. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but lacks context on which network function or application these resources belong to. | 4.7 | A clear, well-structured intent that effectively captures a common resource modification scenario with multiple competing goals. |
| 49 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 65days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 4 | Using a Genetic Algorithm for "intelligent insights" is a plausible but non-standard application for generating alerts. The concept of trend-based notifications from historical data is valid. | 5 | This describes a highly complex notification system that relies on an advanced AI model (Genetic Algorithm) and long-term historical data analysis to generate predictive or trend-based alerts. | 4 | The language is a bit jargony ("intelligent insights") but the core request for trend-based notifications using a specific algorithm and data window is clear. | 5 | The request to "Alert using..." and generate "notifications" fits the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 4 | The connection between a genetic algorithm and trend-based notifications is conceptually coherent, though less direct than using time-series forecasting models. | 5 | The components—an AI algorithm, a long historical data window, and trend-based alerting—are consistent with an advanced, proactive monitoring system. | 4 | The intent is complete in describing the 'how' (GA, historical analysis) but could be more specific about 'what' trends or anomalies to alert on. | 4.4 | An innovative and complex intent for proactive notifications, though the choice of a Genetic Algorithm for this specific task is unusual. |
| 50 | Modification Intent | "Adjust network high-capacity to 5837Mbps broadband allocation and 848954_devices_per_km2 connection density requirements, accommodating growing user demands and traffic patterns." | 5 | The intent uses standard network planning parameters: capacity (Mbps for eMBB) and connection density (devices/km² for mMTC). | 4 | This is a complex, network-wide modification intent that involves adjusting key capacity and density parameters to meet evolving demand. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, specifying the target parameters and values, and provides a clear business justification. | 5 | The action "Adjust network..." is a clear `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the specific parameter changes to the high-level driver ("accommodating growing user demands"). | 5 | The specified high capacity and very high connection density are consistent with a dense urban or smart city deployment scenario. | 4 | As a high-level intent, it's clear.

CPU-based scaling is a common technique for resource management in virtualized environments. | 4 | This intent describes a complex assurance loop where performance targets (throughput, latency) are to be met by using an intelligent scaling mechanism. | 4 | The phrase "high-throughput high-capacity" is slightly redundant. Otherwise, the intent is clear and the instance ID is good practice. | 5 | The goal to "Implement... networking achieving..." specific performance targets is a clear `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | It coherently links the desired performance outcomes with the specific mechanism (CPU-based scaling) intended to achieve them. | 5 | The target KPIs (1000Mbps, 5ms) are demanding but consistent with a high-performance 5G service. The scaling mechanism is a plausible enabler. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but lacks context on the specific service or slice to which these performance targets and scaling mechanisms apply. | 4.6 | A strong intent that clearly defines performance goals and the mechanism to assure them, with only minor redundancy in phrasing. |
| 53 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 101 x86_64 processing cores at 3.8GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies a standard NF (AMF) and uses standard terms for compute resources (x86_64, cores, GHz). | 3 | This is a straightforward feasibility check focusing only on CPU parameters, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and uses standard technical terms, ensuring high readability. | 5 | The description to "Assess... feasibility" is a direct and accurate match for the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the target NF (AMF) with the hardware resources to be evaluated and the criteria for evaluation. | 5 | The specified parameters (101 cores at 3.8GHz) are internally consistent for a massive-scale compute server. | 3 | The check is incomplete as it omits essential resources like memory, storage, and network I/O, which are critical for AMF feasibility. | 4.4 | A clear and relevant feasibility check, but its practical value is limited by the lack of memory and other resource specifications. |
| 54 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 449GB DDR5 memory and 7043GB SATA_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms (DDR5, SATA SSD). The request is a valid engineering task, but the wording is slightly circular. | 3 | The intent is to assess the feasibility of the given resources. The phrasing "Evaluate... requirements for..." is confusing. SATA SSD is also an unusual choice for a "mission-critical performance" analysis. | 4 | The intent is mostly understandable, but could be clearer. The choice of SATA SSD for a high-performance context is questionable. | 5 | The request to "Evaluate" and perform "performance impact analysis" aligns with the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | It logically connects the hardware resources to the need for a performance analysis. | 3 | The choice of SATA SSD, which is slower than NVMe, is inconsistent with a "mission-critical performance impact analysis" where storage I/O is often a bottleneck. | 3 | The intent is critically incomplete as it fails to specify the workload, service, or network function for which these resources are being evaluated. | 3.9 | This intent suffers from circular phrasing, an inconsistent choice of storage technology for the stated goal, and a critical lack of information about the target workload. |

| 57 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | `EAP-AKA'` is a standard authentication protocol. `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP algorithm identifier, which is a minor inaccuracy. | 4 | This intent defines a multi-condition notification rule based on several security events (authentication, encryption, key management), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly structured and easy to understand, specifying triggers and associated event information unambiguously. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events is a direct match for the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 5 | The intent logically groups various security-related events into a cohesive monitoring and notification policy. | 4 | The use of the non-standard term `256_NEA1` is a minor inconsistency.

| 58 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 60days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 4 | Using a Genetic Algorithm for generating alerts is a plausible but non-standard approach. Trend-based notifications from historical data is a valid concept. | 5 | This describes a highly complex notification system that relies on a specific AI model (Genetic Algorithm) and long-term data analysis to generate proactive, trend-based alerts. | 4 | The phrase "intelligent insights" is jargon, but the core request for trend-based notifications using a specific algorithm and data window is understandable. | 5 | The request to "Alert using..." and generate "notifications" fits the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 4 | The link between a genetic algorithm and trend analysis is conceptually coherent, though other time-series models are more common for this task. | 5 | The components—an AI algorithm, a long historical data window, and trend-based alerting—are consistent with an advanced monitoring system. | 4 | The intent is complete in describing the methodology but could be more specific about what KPIs or trends should trigger a notification. | 4.4 | An innovative and complex intent for proactive notifications.

| 60 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 17 x86_64 processing cores at 3.99GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies a standard NF (AMF) and uses standard terms for compute resources (x86_64, cores, GHz). | 3 | This is a straightforward feasibility check focusing only on CPU parameters for a single NF, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and uses standard technical terms, ensuring high readability. | 5 | The description to "Assess... feasibility" is a direct and accurate match for the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the target NF (AMF) with the hardware resources to be evaluated and the criteria for evaluation. | 5 | The specified parameters (17 cores at 3.99GHz) are internally consistent for a medium-to-large AMF instance. | 3 | The check is incomplete as it omits essential resources like memory, storage, and network I/O, which are critical for AMF feasibility. | 4.4 | A clear and relevant feasibility check, but its practical value is limited by the lack of memory and other resource specifications. |
| 61 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 110 processing cores and 46GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The intent modifies standard compute parameters (cores, memory) and an operational parameter (timeout). The goals of performance and cost efficiency are standard. | 4 | This is a complex modification as it involves balancing three factors: compute resources, a performance constraint (timeout), and a business constraint (cost efficiency). | 5 | The intent is clearly written, specifying the exact resource values and constraints, and stating the desired outcome. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and fitting description for a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the resource adjustment and timeout constraint to the dual goals of optimizing performance and maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | The allocation of a very high number of cores (110) with a relatively small amount of memory (46GB) is an unusual ratio, suggesting a very specific CPU-bound workload. It's not inconsistent, but atypical. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but lacks context on which network function or application these resources belong to. | 4.6 | A clear, well-structured intent for resource modification, though the specified core-to-memory ratio is unusual. |
| 62 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 40 core utilization and 191GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Fully aligned with network management practices, targeting a standard 5G NF (AMF) with common performance metrics. | 4 | This is a complex request, requiring analysis of significant resource allocation and the generation of high-priority optimization advice. | 5 | The structure is clear, logical, and uses standard, unambiguous terminology. | 5 | The action "Generate... report" is a perfect match for the `Intent Report Request` type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, connecting the analysis of performance metrics directly to the goal of resource optimization. | 5 | The specified resource values (40 cores, 191GB) are consistent and appropriate for a large AMF instance. | 4 | The intent is complete and provides a clear, actionable directive for the reporting system. | 4.7 | A high-quality example of a performance reporting intent, demonstrating clarity, technical correctness, and actionable detail. |

The intent is fully aligned with 5G security standards. | 4 | The intent defines a notification rule with multiple triggers related to different security aspects (authentication, confidentiality, key management), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The language is precise, and the structure "Alert on X or Y with Z" is clear and easily parsable. | 5 | The description to "Alert on" events and provide "notifications" is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently combines monitoring of authentication, encryption, and key lifecycle events into a single security policy. | 5 | All specified mechanisms and timings are internally consistent and reflect a valid security monitoring scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly defining the conditions and associated event information for the notification. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned security notification intent that is clear, complete, and actionable. |
| 66 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_TLS authentication frameworks and 128_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-1866-3049] | 5 | The intent correctly identifies standard security mechanisms (EAP-TLS, `128-NEA2`/AES) and a common operational requirement to balance security with performance. | 4 | This represents a complex assurance goal, requiring the system to continuously monitor and manage the trade-off between security overhead and network performance. | 5 | The language is clear and unambiguous, and the instance ID enhances its utility in an automated system. | 5 | The goal to "Secure... infrastructure" while maintaining performance is a textbook example of a `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | It coherently links the implementation of specific security protocols with the constraint of not degrading performance. | 5 | The chosen security methods and the performance constraint are consistent with real-world network operations challenges. | 4 | The intent is strong but could be more complete by quantifying the "performance characteristics" to be maintained (e.g., latency < X ms). | 4.7 | An excellent intent that clearly articulates the critical operational challenge of implementing strong security without performance degradation. |
| 67 | Deployment Intent | Optimize cloud-native performance achieving 7855Mbps high-throughput targets and 47.4ms latency requirements through intelligent resource allocation and traffic optimization. | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. "Cloud-native performance" is a valid concept. This is more of a performance assurance or modification intent than a deployment one. | 4 | The intent describes a complex optimization goal with high-performance targets, to be achieved through advanced mechanisms like intelligent allocation and traffic optimization. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated, with specific performance targets and the methods to achieve them. | 3 | While it uses the word "Optimize," it's framed as achieving a target state. It could be interpreted as deploying an optimization function, but `Performance Assurance` would be a better fit. | 5 | It coherently links the performance goals (throughput, latency) with the means to achieve them (resource allocation, traffic optimization). | 5 | The specified high throughput and moderate latency are consistent with an eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband) service. | 4 | The intent provides clear performance targets but lacks context on the service or application they apply to. | 4.3 | A well-defined performance optimization goal that is slightly mismatched with the `Deployment Intent` type. |

UDM network function" is a perfect `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently specifies all the necessary components for a deployment: the what (UDM), the software, the hardware platform, and the resources. | 4 | The allocation of only a single core for an "enterprise-grade" UDM seems low and potentially inconsistent with the "high-performance" descriptor, but it could be for a small enterprise. | 5 | This is a very complete intent, providing enough information for an automated orchestrator to begin a deployment process. | 4.7 | An excellent, detailed, and actionable deployment intent, with a minor question regarding the consistency of a single core for a "high-performance" role. |

[Instance-1870-3076] | 5 | The intent specifies standard performance KPIs (throughput, latency). CPU-based scaling is a common technique for resource management in virtualized environments. | 4 | This intent describes a complex assurance loop where performance targets (throughput, latency) are to be met by using an intelligent scaling mechanism. | 4 | The phrase "high-throughput high-capacity" is slightly redundant. Otherwise, the intent is clear and the instance ID is good practice. | 5 | The goal to "Implement... networking achieving..." specific performance targets is a clear `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | It coherently links the desired performance outcomes with the specific mechanism (CPU-based scaling) intended to achieve them. | 5 | The target KPIs (1000Mbps, 5ms) are demanding but consistent with a high-performance 5G service. The scaling mechanism is a plausible enabler. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but lacks context on the specific service or slice to which these performance targets and scaling mechanisms apply. | 4.6 | A strong intent that clearly defines performance goals and the mechanism to assure them, with only minor redundancy in phrasing. |

The instance ID is a plus. | 5 | The goal of "Secure performance assurance" aligns perfectly with the `Performance Assurance Intent` type. | 5 | The intent coherently groups authentication, encryption, and key management as components of a comprehensive security assurance strategy. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms and key management policy are internally consistent. | 4 | The intent clearly specifies the security methods but does not define the performance characteristics to be assured (e.g., latency, throughput). | 4.7 | A strong intent for security assurance that clearly specifies the mechanisms, though it could be improved by adding specific performance targets. |
| 72 | Deployment Intent | "Launch medium priority network service guaranteeing 9Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 1.4ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | This intent correctly uses standard 5G QoS parameters: Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB), as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. | 4 | Deploying a service with guaranteed QoS, especially with a strict delay budget, is a complex task requiring careful network configuration. | 5 | The language is precise, and the intent clearly specifies the key performance parameters of the service. | 5 | The action "Launch... network service" is a clear and appropriate use of `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the technical QoS parameters to the service's purpose ("supporting mission-critical applications"). | 5 | The combination of a moderate bitrate (9Mbps) and a strict delay (1.4ms) is consistent with certain mission-critical control applications (e.g., industrial robotics). | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing all the necessary QoS information (priority, GBR, PDB) to define the service. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that clearly and completely specifies the deployment of a QoS-enabled network service. |

| 76 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 263GB DDR5 memory and 1862GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms (DDR5, Optane storage). The intent to evaluate these for a workload is a valid engineering task. | 3 | The intent is to assess the feasibility of the given resources, but the wording "Evaluate... requirements for..." is slightly circular. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the phrasing could be more direct, such as "Assess feasibility of a workload using...". | 5 | The core request to "Evaluate" and conduct a "performance impact analysis" fits the `Intent Feasibility Check` category. | 5 | It coherently links the specified hardware components to the required performance analysis. | 5 | The combination of DDR5 RAM and Optane persistent memory is a consistent and modern configuration for high-performance applications. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it does not specify the application or network function that would use these resources, making the evaluation impossible. | 4.1 | A technically plausible hardware evaluation intent that is rendered incomplete by the absence of the target workload. |
| 77 | Modification Intent | "Update QoS flow 5QI_66_Mission_Critical_Signaling configuration with mission-critical 416Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality." | 4 | The intent correctly uses `5QI 66`, a standardized QoS identifier for Mission Critical signaling from 3GPP TS 23.501. However, a 416Mbps bitrate is exceptionally high for what is typically low-volume signaling traffic. | 4 | Modifying QoS configurations for mission-critical flows is a complex and sensitive task. | 5 | The intent is highly readable, using precise, standard terminology in a well-structured sentence. | 5 | The action "Update... configuration" is a clear example of a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the modification of a specific QoS flow with a target bitrate and the overall goal of enhancing traffic handling. | 2 | The specified bitrate (416Mbps) is extremely and unrealistically high for a signaling flow (`5QI 66`), which is expected to carry small, frequent control messages. This is a major inconsistency. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the exact QoS flow to modify, the parameter to change (maximum bitrate), and the target value. | 4.3 | A well-structured and clear intent that is marred by a highly inconsistent and unrealistic bitrate value for the specified mission-critical signaling QoS flow. |

The wording "standard optimized" and "ultra-ultra-reliable" is non-standard and convoluted. | 5 | This is an extremely complex deployment intent, specifying slice type, RAN technology, beamforming, multiple spectrum bands, and a coverage scenario. | 2 | The sentence structure is long, complex, and poorly organized with phrases like "standard optimized with high-priority enhanced monitoring capabilities ultra-ultra-reliable..." making it very difficult to read and parse. | 5 | The core action is a "network slice deployment," which clearly fits the `Deployment Intent` type. | 3 | While the individual technical components are logically related (e.g., Massive MIMO for URLLC), the overall sentence structure is incoherent and jumbled. | 5 | The technical parameters are consistent: Massive MIMO with 3D beamforming across multiple bands is a valid strategy for delivering URLLC in an urban microcell environment. | 5 | Despite the poor readability, the intent is remarkably complete, covering almost all key aspects of a slice deployment from service type to radio configuration. | 4.1 | A technically rich and complete intent that is severely let down by convoluted phrasing and poor sentence structure, making it almost unreadable. |

| 80 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 637533_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and 5G_AKA/256_NEA2 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 4 | Device density and security overhead (from `5G-AKA`) are valid performance considerations. `256_NEA2` is non-standard terminology for the AES-based algorithm. | 5 | This is a highly complex feasibility check, requiring analysis of the combined impact of massive device density (mMTC) and specific security protocols on overall system performance and scalability. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, specifying exactly what factors need to be considered in the analysis. | 5 | The request to "Consider... impact" is a form of feasibility analysis, making it a good fit for the intent type. | 5 | It coherently links two major system stressors—high connection density and security processing—to be analyzed together for their impact on performance. | 4 | The term `256_NEA2` is a minor inconsistency. The other parameters are consistent with a stress-test feasibility study. | 4 | The intent is quite complete in defining the scope of the analysis, though it doesn't specify which "system" is being evaluated (e.g., the RAN, AMF, or the entire network). | 4.6 | A strong, complex intent for a crucial feasibility analysis, with only a minor terminological inaccuracy. |

| 83 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 16hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is standard. `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP algorithm identifier, which is a minor inaccuracy. | 4 | This intent defines a multi-condition notification rule based on several security events (authentication, encryption, key management), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly structured and easy to understand, specifying triggers and associated event information unambiguously. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events is a direct match for the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 5 | The intent logically groups various security-related events into a cohesive monitoring and notification policy. | 4 | The use of the non-standard term `256_NEA1` is a minor inconsistency.

"Transport network optimization" is a valid but very high-level concept. | 4 | This intent is complex as it links modifications in two different domains: core network compute resources and transport network optimization, implying a cross-domain operation. | 3 | The phrase "with transport network optimization" is vague. It's unclear if this is a goal, a constraint, or a concurrent action, which reduces readability. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify core network... allocation," clearly aligns with the `Modification Intent` type. | 3 | The connection between modifying compute resources and optimizing the transport network is logical but not well-defined, lacking coherence. | 4 | The specified compute resources are plausible. The link to transport optimization is not contradictory, just underspecified. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It doesn't state which core network function's resources are being modified, and the transport optimization part is too vague to be actionable. | 3.6 | While the intent addresses a relevant cross-domain modification, its vagueness and incompleteness make it difficult to interpret and act upon. |

"lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism" is descriptive but not a standard model name. | 5 | This describes a highly complex, closed-loop assurance system using a specific type of ML model with a defined performance target (accuracy) for autonomous management. | 4 | The intent is technically dense but logically structured. The model name is long and slightly convoluted. | 5 | The goal to "Implement autonomous performance optimization" is a clear `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | It coherently links the goal (optimization) with the method (a specific ML model) and a performance metric for that method (prediction accuracy). | 5 | Using an LSTM with attention for network predictions is a consistent and valid AI/ML approach.

| 125 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-deterministic performance infrastructure using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols without compromising deterministic performance characteristics. | 4 | `EAP-AKA'` is a standard protocol. `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP identifier. "Deterministic performance" is a valid, stringent requirement. | 4 | This intent addresses the complex trade-off between security and highly predictable (deterministic) performance, implying a sophisticated assurance mechanism. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated and uses precise language to describe the goal and constraints. | 5 | The goal to "Secure... infrastructure" while assuring performance is a perfect match for the `Performance Assurance Intent` type. | 5 | It coherently links security mechanisms (authentication, encryption) with a non-functional requirement (deterministic performance). | 4 | The use of the non-standard term `256_NEA1` is a minor inconsistency.

| 127 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 255.32ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | This intent correctly uses standard 5G QoS parameters: Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB), as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501. | 4 | Deploying a service with guaranteed QoS is a complex undertaking, requiring resource management and policy enforcement across the network. | 3 | The excessive repetition of "critical" and "mission-critical" makes the sentence redundant and reduces readability. | 5 | The action "Launch... network service" is a clear and appropriate use of `Deployment Intent`. | 4 | The core logic is coherent, but the repetitive phrasing slightly obscures the link between the QoS parameters and the application requirements. | 4 | The combination of a very low bitrate (1Mbps) with a high delay budget (255ms) for a "mission-critical" service is unusual. It might fit a specific use case (e.g., reliable telemetry) but is not typical. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing all the necessary QoS information (priority, GBR, PDB) to define the service. | 4.3 | A complete and standards-aligned intent whose quality is reduced by poor readability and a questionable combination of QoS parameters for a "mission-critical" label. |
| 128 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 80 processing cores and 74GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | The intent correctly identifies core network resource allocation (CPU, memory) as a modifiable parameter. "Transport network optimization" is a valid but very high-level concept. | 4 | This intent is complex as it links modifications in two different domains: core network compute resources and transport network optimization, implying a cross-domain operation. | 3 | The phrase "with transport network optimization" is vague. It's unclear if this is a goal, a constraint, or a concurrent action, which reduces readability. | 5 | The primary action, "Modify core network... allocation," clearly aligns with the `Modification Intent` type. | 3 | The connection between modifying compute resources and optimizing the transport network is logical but not well-defined, lacking coherence. | 4 | The specified compute resources are plausible. The link to transport optimization is not contradictory, just underspecified. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It doesn't state which core network function's resources are being modified, and the transport optimization part is too vague to be actionable. | 3.6 | While the intent addresses a relevant cross-domain modification, its vagueness and incompleteness make it difficult to interpret and act upon. |

RISC-V is a plausible architecture. | 3 | The intent specifies core hardware attributes but does not include other critical factors like memory or network I/O. | 5 | The request is concise, clear, and uses precise technical language that is easy to parse. | 5 | The description directly aligns with the `Intent Feasibility Check` type by asking to "Assess... feasibility". | 5 | The components of the request—assessing feasibility for an AMF deployment based on specific compute resources—are logically linked. | 5 | All parameters provided (AMF, RISC-V, 40 cores, 3.06GHz) are consistent with a hardware feasibility assessment. | 3 | While specific about CPU, it lacks memory, storage, and networking requirements, which are crucial for a complete feasibility check. | 4.3 | A clear and relevant feasibility check intent, though it could be more complete by including memory and I/O specifications. |
| 171 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 94 processing cores and 77GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The intent modifies standard compute parameters (cores, memory) and an operational parameter (timeout). The goals of performance and cost efficiency are standard. | 4 | This is a complex modification as it involves balancing three factors: compute resources, a performance constraint (timeout), and a business constraint (cost efficiency). | 5 | The intent is clearly written, specifying the exact resource values and constraints, and stating the desired outcome. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and fitting description for a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the resource adjustment and timeout constraint to the dual goals of optimizing performance and maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | The allocation of a very high number of cores (94) with a relatively small amount of memory (77GB) is an unusual ratio, suggesting a very specific CPU-bound workload. It's not inconsistent, but atypical. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but lacks context on which network function or application these resources belong to. | 4.6 | A clear, well-structured intent for resource modification, though the specified core-to-memory ratio is unusual. |
| 172 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Simulated_Annealing intelligent insights with mission-critical 90days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 4 | Simulated Annealing is a valid optimization/search algorithm, but its application for generating "intelligent insights" for alerts is non-standard and less common than other ML models. Trend-based notification from historical data is a valid concept. | 5 | This describes a highly complex notification system that relies on a specific heuristic algorithm and long-term historical data analysis to generate proactive alerts. | 4 | The phrase "intelligent insights" is jargon, but the core request for trend-based notifications using a specific algorithm and data window is understandable. | 5 | The request to "Alert using..." and generate "notifications" fits the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 4 | The link between simulated annealing and trend-based notifications is conceptually plausible (e.g., finding an optimal threshold) but indirect. | 5 | The components—an AI algorithm, a long historical data window, and trend-based alerting—are consistent with an advanced monitoring system. | 4 | The intent is complete in describing the methodology but could be more specific about what KPIs or trends should trigger a notification. | 4.4 | An innovative and complex intent for proactive notifications. The choice of Simulated Annealing is unusual but technically plausible. |
| 173 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 23hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | `EAP-AKA'` is a standard protocol. `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP identifier, a minor inaccuracy. | 4 | This intent defines a multi-condition notification rule based on several security events (authentication, encryption, key management). | 5 | The intent is clearly structured and easy to understand, specifying triggers and associated event information unambiguously. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events is a direct match for the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 5 | The intent logically groups various security-related events into a cohesive monitoring and notification policy. | 4 | The use of the non-standard term `256_NEA1` is a minor inconsistency. The other parameters are consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating the conditions that should trigger an alert and what related information to include. | 4.6 | A strong and clear security notification intent, with only a minor deviation from standard 3GPP terminology for the encryption algorithm. |
| 174 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 40 processing cores and 197GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The intent modifies standard compute parameters (cores, memory) and an operational parameter (timeout). The goals of performance and cost efficiency are standard. | 4 | This is a complex modification as it involves balancing three factors: compute resources, a performance constraint (timeout), and a business constraint (cost efficiency). | 5 | The intent is clearly written, specifying the exact resource values and constraints, and stating the desired outcome. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a direct and fitting description for a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the resource adjustment and timeout constraint to the dual goals of optimizing performance and maintaining cost efficiency. | 5 | The specified parameters are internally consistent for a memory-intensive application. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but lacks context on which network function or application these resources belong to. | 4.7 | A clear, well-structured intent that effectively captures a common resource modification scenario with multiple competing goals. |

| 176 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with mission-critical 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 78Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 4 | `4T4R` MIMO, `3D_Beamforming`, and backhaul capacity are standard terms. However, `3D_Beamforming` is typically associated with Massive MIMO arrays, not "Traditional_MIMO_4T4R," making this combination inconsistent. | 4 | The intent describes a multi-faceted modification to an antenna system, including beamforming and backhaul, indicating a reasonably complex task. | 5 | The intent is clearly structured, uses precise terminology, and is easy to understand for a network engineer. | 5 | The action "Reconfigure" makes this a clear and appropriate `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The intent logically connects the antenna system, beamforming type, and backhaul upgrade to the high-level goals. | 2 | There is a major inconsistency: 3D Beamforming (which steers beams both horizontally and vertically) requires a large vertical antenna array, which is a key feature of Massive MIMO, not traditional 4T4R systems. | 5 | It's a complete modification request, specifying the target, the actions to perform, and the desired capacity enhancement. | 4.3 | A clear and complete intent that is undermined by a significant technical inconsistency between the antenna type (4T4R) and the specified beamforming technology (3D). |
| 177 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 191GB HBM2 memory and 2031GB NVMe_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard high-performance hardware terms (HBM2, NVMe SSD). The request is a valid engineering task, but the wording is slightly circular. | 3 | The intent is to assess the feasibility of the given resources. The phrasing "Evaluate... requirements for..." is confusing. | 4 | The intent is mostly understandable, but could be clearer. | 5 | The request to "Evaluate" and perform "performance impact analysis" aligns with the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | It logically connects the hardware resources to the need for a performance analysis. | 5 | The specified memory (High Bandwidth Memory) and storage types are consistent with a very high-performance computing task. | 3 | The intent is critically incomplete as it fails to specify the workload, service, or network function for which these resources are being evaluated. | 4.1 | A good intent for a high-performance hardware evaluation that is hampered by circular phrasing and a critical lack of information about the target workload. |
| 178 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 127ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.003606 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate are standard 5G QoS parameters (3GPP TS 23.501). The intent is fully aligned with QoS standards. | 4 | Configuring and assuring service with both a delay and an error rate constraint is a complex task requiring sophisticated QoS mechanisms. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, with precise, quantifiable performance targets. | 5 | The goal to "Configure... implementing... quality assurance mechanisms" is a strong fit for a `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | It coherently links the specific QoS parameter targets with the methods needed to achieve and maintain them (traffic engineering, QA). | 5 | The specified delay and error rate are consistent with a reliable, though not ultra-low-latency, service. | 4 | The intent is very complete in defining the performance targets but lacks context on the specific service or slice to which they apply. | 4.7 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that clearly specifies a multi-parameter QoS assurance goal. |
| 179 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 3hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | `EAP-TLS` is a standard protocol. `256_NEA1` is not a standard 3GPP identifier, a minor inaccuracy. | 4 | This intent defines a multi-condition notification rule based on several security events (authentication, encryption, key management). | 5 | The intent is clearly structured and easy to understand, specifying triggers and associated event information unambiguously. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" events is a direct match for the `Regular Notification Request` type. | 5 | The intent logically groups various security-related events into a cohesive monitoring and notification policy. | 4 | The use of the non-standard term `256_NEA1` is a minor inconsistency. The other parameters are consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating the conditions that should trigger an alert and what related information to include. | 4.6 | A strong and clear security notification intent, with only a minor deviation from standard 3GPP terminology for the encryption algorithm. |
| 180 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 16 core utilization and 465GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent is perfectly aligned with standard network management procedures, targeting the AMF with common performance metrics. | 4 | The request is complex due to the analysis of a resource footprint with an unusual ratio (low core count, very high memory) and the need for detailed recommendations. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and uses clear, standard terminology. | 5 | The instruction to "Generate... report" is a direct match for the `Intent Report Request` type. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the analysis target (AMF performance) with the desired outcome (optimization recommendations). | 4 | The ratio of 16 cores to 465GB of memory is highly unusual for an AMF, suggesting a very specific, memory-intensive workload or potential misconfiguration. It's not inconsistent, but it is atypical. | 4 | The intent is complete and provides a clear, actionable directive for the reporting and analytics system. | 4.6 | A high-quality intent for a performance report, notable for the unusual resource ratio which would be a key point of the analysis. |
| 181 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate NWDAF deployment through nfvo_ac6c1772b274 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_cddc540b0bf1 VNF Manager integration. | 5 | The intent correctly references the ETSI MANO architecture (NFVO, VNFM) for deploying an NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function), a standard 5G NF. | 4 | This describes a complex, orchestrated deployment involving multiple management components to deploy the analytics function of the 5G core. | 5 | The language is very clear and precise, using standard acronyms and identifiers that are ideal for automation. | 5 | The request to "Coordinate NWDAF deployment" is a clear `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the deployment process, specifying the target NF (NWDAF) and the management entities responsible for the orchestration. | 5 | The roles of NFVO and VNFM in deploying a VNF/CNF are perfectly consistent with the ETSI MANO framework. | 5 | The intent is complete for its level of abstraction, specifying the what (NWDAF deployment) and the how (via specific NFVO/VNFM instances). | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that accurately describes an orchestrated deployment process for the 5G Network Data Analytics Function. |

| 183 | Deployment Intent | "Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 1191Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 10.6ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms." | 5 | Uses standard terms: eMBB, network slice, throughput, latency, QoS. These are all core 5G concepts. | 5 | Achieving these specific, high-performance targets for an eMBB slice is a complex task requiring sophisticated network optimization. | 4 | The repetition of "high-high-throughput" is a minor typo. The intent type is also a mismatch. | 3 | The primary action is to "Optimize... performance," which more closely matches a `Performance Assurance` or `Modification Intent`, not a `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | It coherently links the slice type (eMBB), the performance targets, and the methods to achieve them (traffic engineering, QoS). | 5 | The specified throughput and latency targets are consistent with a high-performance eMBB service. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the slice, the exact performance KPIs and their target values, and the methods to be used. | 4.6 | A technically rich and complete intent that is slightly marred by a minor typo and a mismatched intent type. |

| 185 | Deployment Intent | "Authenticate continuously using fault-tolerant continuous_behavioral_authentication behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms, detecting and preventing sophisticated security threats in real-time." | 4 | Continuous behavioral authentication is an advanced security concept, not a standard 3GPP procedure, but it's a valid approach. | 5 | This describes the deployment of a highly complex, AI-driven security system for real-time threat detection based on behavioral analysis. | 4 | The intent is clear, but "continuous_behavioral_authentication" is presented as a specific algorithm which is more of a concept. | 3 | This is not a typical `Deployment Intent`. It describes the implementation of a security capability or policy, which might fit better under `Performance Assurance` or `Modification`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the method (behavioral analysis, ML) with the goal (real-time threat detection and prevention). | 5 | The components are consistent with a modern zero-trust security architecture. | 4 | It's complete in describing the desired security capability but lacks context on where this should be deployed (e.g., in the core, at the edge). | 4.3 | A forward-looking intent for an advanced security capability, but it is mismatched with the `Deployment Intent` type. |

| 187 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure deterministic performance assurance using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 3hours automated key management. | 4 | `EAP-AKA'` is a standard protocol. `256_NEA2` is not a standard 3GPP identifier, a minor inaccuracy.

However, it's a reasonable fit for the type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the cryptographic function, key properties, and rotation policy to the overall goal of securing orchestration. | 5 | The parameters are consistent: HMAC-SHA512 is a strong algorithm, and automated key rotation is a security best practice. | 4 | It clearly defines the security mechanism to be deployed but lacks context on which orchestration system or interfaces it applies to. | 4.4 | A clear and technically sound intent for deploying a security capability for orchestration systems. |

| 199 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 98 x86_64 processing cores at 3.54GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies a standard NF (AMF) and uses standard terms for compute resources (x86_64, cores, GHz). | 3 | This is a straightforward feasibility check focusing only on CPU parameters for a single NF, making it moderately complex. | 5 | The request is concise, unambiguous, and uses standard technical terms, ensuring high readability. | 5 | The description to "Assess... feasibility" is a direct and accurate match for the `Intent Feasibility Check` type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the target NF (AMF) with the hardware resources to be evaluated and the criteria for evaluation. | 5 | The specified parameters (98 cores at 3.54GHz) are internally consistent for a massive-scale compute server. | 3 | The check is incomplete as it omits essential resources like memory, storage, and network I/O, which are critical for AMF feasibility. | 4.4 | A clear and relevant feasibility check, but its practical value is limited by the lack of memory and other resource specifications. |
| 200 | Deployment Intent | "Execute mission-critical massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems deployment with mission-critical Non_Standalone_5G network architecture and Massive_MIMO_64T64R MIMO antenna systems, ensuring ultra-reliable massive connectivity for critical applications." | 4 | Uses standard terms (mMTC, NSA, Massive MIMO). However, Non-Standalone (NSA) architecture relies on a 4G EPC core, which is less ideal for advanced 5G services like mMTC compared to a 5G Standalone (SA) core. | 5 | This is a complex deployment intent, specifying a service type, network architecture, and advanced RAN technology. | 3 | The excessive repetition of "mission-critical" and the slightly awkward phrasing reduce readability. | 5 | The action "Execute... deployment" is a clear `Deployment Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently links the service type (mMTC), the architecture (NSA), and the RAN technology (Massive MIMO). | 3 | There is a strategic inconsistency. While technically possible, deploying a new, advanced mMTC service over an older NSA architecture is not the standard or optimal approach; 5G SA is designed for these services. | 4 | The intent is complete in describing the high-level components of the deployment but lacks specific performance targets. | 4.1 | A technically detailed intent that is coherent but based on a questionable architectural choice (NSA for mMTC), and suffers from poor readability. |
