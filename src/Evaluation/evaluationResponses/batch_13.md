|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 13 RISC_V processing cores at 1.62GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 4 | AMF is a valid 5G Network Function (NF). Specifying CPU architecture (RISC_V) and clock speed is a valid, low-level infrastructure consideration, aligned with NFV principles. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, mentioning core count, architecture (RISC_V), and a precise clock speed, which adds significant detail. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and grammatically correct, making it easy for both humans and automation to parse. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Assess...feasibility," which directly matches the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The request is structured logically, stating the goal (assess AMF deployment) and the specific constraints to consider. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions; all parameters are aligned with the goal of a hardware feasibility check. | 4 | The intent specifies core requirements but could be more complete by including memory or storage parameters for a full assessment. | 4.6 | This is a well-defined and technically specific intent for assessing the feasibility of deploying a 5G core function on particular hardware. |
| 2 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 190ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.007125 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | The use of "packet delay budget" and "error rate" directly corresponds to the Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER) QoS parameters in 3GPP TS 23.501. | 4 | The intent provides highly specific numerical values for two key performance indicators (PDB and PER), making it complex. | 5 | The sentence is well-formed and clearly communicates the performance targets and required actions. | 5 | The description is focused on configuring and assuring specific performance metrics, which is the core purpose of this intent type. | 5 | The intent logically connects performance targets (delay, error rate) with the means to achieve them (traffic engineering). | 4 | Labeling a 190ms delay as "mission-critical" is slightly inconsistent, as mission-critical services usually require much lower latency (e.g., URLLC). However, it's not a direct contradiction. | 4 | While key performance parameters are defined, the intent lacks context, such as the specific service or slice this configuration applies to. | 4.6 | A clear and standards-aligned intent specifying precise QoS parameters, though the term "mission-critical" is debatable for the given delay. |
| 3 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 461GB HBM2 memory and 9968GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | The specified hardware (HBM2, NVMe_PCIe4) is realistic for high-performance NFV infrastructure (NFVI) hosting 5G functions, aligning with ETSI NFV standards. | 4 | The intent details specific memory/storage technologies and very large, precise capacities, indicating a high level of technical complexity. | 5 | The description is unambiguous and clearly states the components and analysis required. | 5 | The action "Evaluate memory and storage requirements" is a perfect example of a feasibility check. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, linking the hardware evaluation to the required performance impact analysis. | 5 | The specified components are consistent with a high-performance system, with no conflicting requirements. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't mention which network function or service the resources are for, which is critical for a "performance impact analysis." | 4.4 | This intent clearly specifies a feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but it lacks the necessary context of the workload for a complete analysis. |
| 4 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 55 core utilization and 494GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The focus on AMF performance, core utilization, and memory consumption is perfectly aligned with the monitoring and management of 5G NFs as described in 3GPP management specifications (e.g., TS 28 series). | 4 | The request is complex, asking for a specific type of report (deterministic performance analytics), analysis of multiple metrics, and actionable recommendations. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated, with no ambiguity about what needs to be generated and analyzed. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Generate comprehensive... report," which is the purpose of an Intent Report Request. | 5 | The structure is logical: generate a report, specify the subject (AMF performance), the metrics (cores, memory), and the desired output (recommendations). | 5 | All elements of the request are consistent and contribute to the single goal of generating a detailed performance report. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF (AMF), the metrics to analyze, and the expected outcome of the report. | 4.9 | An excellent, well-formed, and complete intent for generating a specific and actionable performance report for a 5G AMF. |
| 5 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 49 core utilization and 427GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies AMF as a target for performance analytics and focuses on standard metrics like core utilization and memory consumption, aligning with 3GPP operational principles. | 4 | This request is complex due to its specificity regarding the analysis metrics (core/memory usage) and the required output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable, making the requested action unambiguous. | 5 | The description's primary verb "Generate... report" perfectly aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, detailing the subject of the report (AMF), the specific data points for analysis, and the expected outcome. | 5 | The details are internally consistent and all contribute to the overarching goal of a performance report. | 5 | The intent is fully specified, leaving no doubt about which NF to analyze, what metrics to consider, and what the report should contain. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and actionable intent that effectively requests a detailed performance report for a critical 5G network function. |
| 6 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 18hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-2406-6131] | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is a valid method. 128-NEA1 is a valid 3GPP NAS encryption algorithm. The concepts align with 3GPP TS 33.501, though NEA1 is from EPS (4G). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions (authentication failures, security breaches) and a related notification schedule (key rotation), adding complexity. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased, defining the conditions for the alert and the associated notification timing. | 5 | The description "Alert on..." is a direct expression of a regular notification request. | 4 | It logically defines alert triggers but somewhat awkwardly links them to a separate timed notification for key rotation rather than an immediate alert on the failure itself. | 4 | The combination of real-time failure alerts and a scheduled key rotation notification in one statement is slightly inconsistent in timing, but the topics are related. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could be clearer on whether the 18-hour notification is for the rotation event itself or a summary of failures. | 4.3 | A good notification intent with valid security parameters, though the phrasing could better distinguish between immediate alerts and scheduled notifications. |
| 7 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 266GB LPDDR5 memory and 2686GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | LPDDR5 and Optane are valid, modern hardware technologies suitable for NFV infrastructure, consistent with the underlying requirements for hosting 5G functions. | 4 | Specifies exact types and sizes of memory and storage, making it a detailed and complex technical request. | 5 | The description is clear and easy to understand, specifying exactly what needs to be evaluated. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the subject "requirements" directly align with the purpose of a feasibility check. | 5 | The request is coherent, linking the evaluation of specific hardware to a required performance impact analysis. | 4 | The combination of low-power LPDDR5 RAM with high-performance Optane storage is unusual for a server environment but technically possible and not a direct contradiction. | 3 | Like a similar previous intent, it's incomplete because it lacks the context of the NF or workload, which is essential for a meaningful performance impact analysis. | 4.3 | A specific hardware feasibility check that is well-written, but its practical value is limited by the absence of workload context. |
| 8 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 128_NEA1 encryption with high-priority 12hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 is a 3GPP encryption algorithm. These are relevant to securing the network, which is a facet of performance assurance. Aligns with TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security aspects (authentication, encryption, key management) with specific parameters, making it complex. | 5 | The description is clear and specifies the desired security mechanisms and management policy. | 5 | The description aims to "Secure performance assurance," which directly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically groups together related security mechanisms (authentication, encryption, key management) to achieve a secure state. | 5 | The chosen security methods are compatible and work together to provide a consistent security posture. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could be more complete by linking these security settings to a specific service, slice, or network domain. | 4.6 | A strong and clear intent for configuring a specific security posture as part of a performance assurance strategy. |
| 9 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Beamforming_8T8R antenna systems with high-priority Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 13Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and deterministic performance." | 5 | All terms used—Beamforming, 8T8R (a MIMO configuration), Horizontal_Beamforming, and backhaul capacity—are standard and correct concepts in 5G NR radio access networks. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying modifications across multiple radio and transport domains (antenna, beamforming algorithm, backhaul). | 4 | The description is mostly clear, though slightly dense with technical terms. An automation system might need careful parsing. | 5 | The request to "Reconfigure" an existing system is a clear example of a Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the reconfiguration of the antenna and beamforming with the goal of enhancing backhaul and improving performance. | 5 | All the requested modifications are consistent and complementary, aiming for an overall performance improvement. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing details on the antenna system, the specific beamforming type, and the target backhaul capacity. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically detailed, and complete intent for modifying and optimizing the radio access network. |
| 10 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-deterministic performance compute resources with 16 ARM64 cores and 12GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Specifying compute resources (ARM64, DDR4) for network functions is a standard part of the NFV deployment process, as outlined by ETSI NFV standards. | 3 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying core count, architecture, and memory size/type. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily understandable for an orchestrator or engineer. | 5 | "Provision... compute resources" is a direct statement of a deployment action. | 5 | The intent logically links the provisioned resources to their purpose ("for demanding network functions"). | 5 | The specified resources (16 cores, 12GB memory) are a reasonable and consistent combination for a network function instance. | 4 | While it specifies the resources well, it's slightly incomplete as it doesn't name the specific network function to be deployed on them. | 4.6 | A clear and well-formed intent for provisioning hardware resources, slightly incomplete by not naming the target NF. |
| 11 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Simulated_Annealing intelligent insights with mission-critical 130days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | The intent describes a notification mechanism based on AI/ML analytics. While 3GPP's NWDAF (TS 23.288) supports analytics, naming a specific algorithm like "Simulated_Annealing" is more of an implementation detail than a standards-based intent. | 5 | The intent is complex, describing a sophisticated notification system that involves a specific AI/ML technique, fault tolerance, and long-term historical data analysis. | 4 | The description is understandable but uses abstract terms like "intelligent insights" which could be ambiguous for automation. | 5 | The core request is to "Alert," which squarely fits the notification request type. | 5 | The intent coherently describes a process: use a specific analysis method on historical data to generate trend-based alerts. | 5 | All parts of the request are consistent and describe a plausible, advanced monitoring and alerting system. | 4 | The intent is somewhat abstract. It specifies the "how" (Simulated Annealing, 130 days of data) but not the "what" (which specific KPIs or events to alert on). | 4.4 | A sophisticated and complex notification intent, though its abstraction and use of implementation-specific terms make it less practical. |
| 12 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 488ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a key performance metric. The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the closed-loop automation concepts in 3GPP and ETSI ZSM (Zero-touch Service Management). | 4 | The intent specifies a target performance metric and couples it with advanced operational methods (predictive analytics, automated remediation). | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the performance goal and the methods to achieve it. | 5 | The goal to "Optimize performance achieving..." a specific metric is a core example of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome (488ms response time) with the enabling technologies. | 4 | Labeling a 488ms response time as "mission-critical" is questionable, as this is a very high latency for critical services. | 4 | The intent is good but could be more complete by specifying which application or service this response time applies to. | 4.4 | A clear intent for performance optimization using advanced automation, with a slightly inconsistent "mission-critical" label for the specified latency. |
| 13 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 80 core utilization and 152GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on an AMF using metrics like core and memory utilization is perfectly aligned with 3GPP management functions. | 4 | The intent is complex, asking for a specific report on a key NF, with analysis of multiple metrics and "mission-critical" recommendations. | 5 | The request is clearly stated, grammatically correct, and easy to parse. | 5 | The action "Generate comprehensive... report" directly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, specifying the report's subject (AMF), metrics, and expected output (recommendations). | 5 | All components of the request are consistent and work towards the single goal of generating a useful report. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary details for an analytics function to execute the request. | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and complete intent for generating a detailed and actionable AMF performance report. |
| 14 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade UPF network function using ZTE SW_3.7.303 software on high-performance 2-core x86_64 architecture with 15GB DDR5 memory and 191GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | The intent correctly identifies UPF as a 5G NF and specifies its deployment on NFVI, which aligns with 3GPP architecture and ETSI NFV standards. | 5 | This is a highly complex deployment intent, specifying the NF, vendor software version, CPU architecture, core count, memory type/size, and storage type/size. | 5 | The description is very clear, detailed, and leaves no ambiguity for an orchestration system. | 5 | "Deploy... UPF network function" is a quintessential example of a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The intent is perfectly coherent, listing all necessary components for the deployment in a logical order. | 5 | All specified hardware and software components are consistent and form a plausible configuration for a UPF instance. | 5 | The intent is extremely complete, providing a full manifest of software and hardware resources required for the deployment. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a comprehensive and actionable deployment intent, providing all necessary details for automated orchestration. |
| 15 | Deployment Intent | "Execute production-ready comprehensive with high-priority intelligent optimization massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems network slice deployment featuring Massive_MIMO_32T32R antenna systems with high-priority production-ready comprehensive 3D_Beamforming beamforming capabilities across 700MHz/1.8GHz/24GHz spectrum bands, optimized for Urban_Macro coverage scenarios." | 5 | All technical terms—mMTC slice, Massive MIMO 32T32R, 3D Beamforming, spectrum bands, and Urban_Macro scenario—are standard and correctly used 3GPP/5G concepts. | 5 | This is an extremely complex intent, spanning network slicing, RAN configuration (MIMO, beamforming), spectrum allocation, and coverage optimization. | 3 | The readability is low due to repetitive filler words ("production-ready comprehensive," "high-priority") and a long, run-on sentence structure. | 5 | The core action is to "Execute... network slice deployment," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 4 | The intent is logically coherent but its structure is convoluted by the repetitive phrasing, making it hard to follow. | 5 | The combination of an mMTC slice with Massive MIMO and specific bands is technically consistent and valid for an Urban_Macro scenario. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing a rich set of parameters that cover the slice type, radio configuration, and deployment environment. | 4.6 | A technically superb and complete intent that is severely hampered by poor readability and verbose, repetitive language. |
| 16 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 6hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication mechanism. However, `256_NEA1` is incorrect. 3GPP NAS Encryption Algorithms (NEA) like NEA1 are 128-bit. This is a factual error in standards alignment. | 4 | The intent combines monitoring for two different security event types with a timed notification about a third, related event (key rotation). | 5 | Despite the factual error, the sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear. | 5 | The intent begins with "Alert on," which is a clear directive for a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related events, but linking two real-time failure events to a scheduled notification is slightly disjointed. | 4 | The topics are consistent (security), but the algorithm name `256_NEA1` is inconsistent with the 3GPP standard for NEA1. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers clearly, but the exact nature of the 6-hour notification could be more explicit (e.g., is it a summary report or just a notification that a key rotation happened?). | 4.1 | A clear notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by the use of a non-standard/incorrect security algorithm identifier. |
| 17 | Performance Assurance Intent | Monitor comprehensive performance using fault-tolerant Isolation_Forest anomaly detection with mission-critical Jaeger end-to-end tracing capabilities. | 4 | Jaeger is a widely used tracing tool, and its use for end-to-end performance monitoring is valid. Anomaly detection aligns with NWDAF concepts (TS 23.288). "Isolation_Forest" is an implementation detail, not a standard. | 5 | This is a complex intent that specifies the monitoring scope, the desired ML algorithm for anomaly detection, fault tolerance, and the integration of a specific tracing tool. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the term "comprehensive performance" is vague. The rest is specific. | 5 | The goal to "Monitor... performance" is a key aspect of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically connects different tools and techniques (anomaly detection, tracing) to achieve a comprehensive performance monitoring goal. | 5 | The use of an anomaly detection algorithm alongside an end-to-end tracing tool is a consistent and powerful combination for performance assurance. | 4 | The intent is very good but could be more complete by specifying which KPIs to monitor or which service to trace. | 4.6 | A sophisticated performance assurance intent that effectively combines modern monitoring techniques, though it relies on some implementation-specific details. |
| 18 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 93 core utilization and 474GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly targets the AMF for performance analysis and uses standard metrics (core/memory utilization), aligning with 3GPP management specifications. | 4 | The request is specific about the NF, the metrics, and the expected output (recommendations), making it a complex reporting task. | 5 | The phrasing is clear, concise, and unambiguous, making it perfectly suitable for automated processing. | 5 | "Generate... report" is a direct instruction that aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The request is logically structured, moving from the general request to the specific subject, metrics, and desired outcome. | 5 | All components of the request are internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all necessary information to fulfill the reporting request. | 4.9 | An exemplary intent for a performance report: it is clear, complete, standards-aligned, and actionable. |
| 19 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 13hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 is a valid (though legacy 4G) 3GPP encryption algorithm. The concepts align with 3GPP security standards. | 4 | The intent defines multiple trigger conditions and a timed notification for a related security management event, adding complexity. | 5 | The request is clearly written and easy to understand. | 5 | The directive "Alert on..." clearly indicates a notification request. | 4 | The intent logically groups security events but, like others, it slightly awkwardly bundles real-time failure alerts with a scheduled notification. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms (EAP-TLS, 128-NEA1) are consistent and valid. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could clarify the relationship between the failures and the 13-hour notification. | 4.4 | A solid and clear notification intent using valid security terms, with a minor awkwardness in its structure. |
| 20 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 293days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | While NWDAF (TS 23.288) supports analytics, specifying a "Genetic_Algorithm" is an implementation detail, not a standards-based declarative intent. The concept is valid, but the phrasing is not ideal. | 5 | The intent describes a highly complex alerting mechanism involving a specific ML algorithm, fault tolerance, and very long-term historical analysis. | 4 | The description is mostly clear but uses abstract phrases like "intelligent insights" that reduce its direct applicability for automation. | 5 | The core action "Alert" aligns this intent perfectly with its type. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the components of the proposed alerting system: the algorithm, the data source, and the output type. | 5 | All elements are consistent and describe a plausible, if highly advanced, analytical alerting system. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it specifies the method of analysis but not the actual events or KPIs to be monitored. | 4.3 | A complex and forward-looking notification intent that is too focused on implementation details (the specific algorithm) and lacks concrete monitoring targets. |
| 21 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 114 RISC_V processing cores at 2.47GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 4 | Targeting an AMF for deployment on a specific hardware architecture (RISC_V) is a valid NFV scenario. The parameters are plausible. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the highly specific core count, architecture, and clock speed, plus the "mission-critical" qualifier. | 5 | The request is clearly and concisely worded. | 5 | The description "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, stating the goal and the key parameters to be considered in the assessment. | 5 | The specified high core count and clock speed are consistent with a "mission-critical" deployment requirement. | 4 | The intent specifies CPU resources in detail but omits memory and storage, which are also crucial for a complete feasibility assessment. | 4.6 | A strong, specific, and clear intent for a hardware feasibility check, which could be improved by including memory/storage parameters. |
| 22 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate UPF deployment through nfvo_aad49e6722ee Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_47f6f8e8decd VNF Manager integration. | 5 | This intent uses correct terminology from the ETSI NFV MANO (Management and Orchestration) framework, which is the foundation for 5G service orchestration. NFVO and VNFM are standard components. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies the exact orchestrator and manager instances (by ID) to be used, implying a sophisticated, multi-component environment. | 5 | The description is extremely clear and precise, suitable for an automated controller that interacts with a MANO system. | 5 | "Coordinate UPF deployment" is a clear statement of a deployment intent. | 5 | The intent logically and correctly describes the standard orchestration workflow where an NFVO coordinates with a VNFM for deployment. | 5 | The roles of the NFVO and VNFM are correctly described and are consistent with the ETSI MANO architecture. | 5 | The intent is complete for its level of abstraction, clearly delegating the deployment action to the specified MANO components. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that accurately reflects a real-world orchestration process using ETSI MANO terminology. |
| 23 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_TLS authentication frameworks and 128_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-2423-6236] | 5 | EAP-TLS is a standard authentication framework, and 128-NEA2 is a standard 3GPP 5G NAS encryption algorithm (specified in TS 33.501). The terminology is correct. | 4 | The intent combines specific security protocol requirements with a qualitative performance constraint ("without compromising performance"). | 5 | The language is clear and effectively communicates the dual goals of security and performance. | 5 | The intent to "Secure high-performance infrastructure" is a perfect fit for the Performance Assurance type. | 5 | The intent coherently links the implementation of specific security protocols to the overarching goal of maintaining performance. | 5 | The chosen security protocols are standard and consistent with securing a 5G network. | 5 | The intent is complete, stating the required security mechanisms and the associated performance constraint. | 4.9 | A very well-formed intent that correctly specifies modern 5G security standards while also stating the crucial non-functional requirement of maintaining performance. |
| 24 | Deployment Intent | "Ensure 99.996% service availability through MAY_PREEMPT preemption capabilities and priority-based resource allocation, maintaining performance guarantees for critical services." | 5 | Service availability, preemption (e.g., ARP Pre-emption Capability/Vulnerability), and priority levels are standard concepts in 3GPP QoS and resource management (TS 23.501). 99.996% is "4.5 nines." | 5 | This intent is complex as it specifies a high-level SLA (availability) and links it to specific low-level mechanisms like preemption and priority allocation. | 5 | The description is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 4 | While this is related to deployment configuration, it reads more like a Performance or Policy intent. However, these settings are often configured at deployment time, so the relevance is acceptable. | 5 | The intent logically connects the high-level goal (availability) to the specific mechanisms required to achieve it. | 5 | High availability, preemption for critical services, and priority allocation are all consistent and complementary concepts. | 4 | The intent is very good but could be more complete by specifying which services are deemed "critical" and what their priority levels are. | 4.7 | A strong, well-defined intent that links a business-level SLA to technical enforcement mechanisms, though its classification as "Deployment" is slightly borderline. |
| 25 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method, and 128-NEA1 is a valid 3GPP encryption algorithm. The terminology is standards-aligned. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct security failure conditions as triggers and links them to a scheduled notification about a third event. | 5 | The sentence is clear, grammatically correct, and easy to parse. | 5 | "Alert on..." is a direct instruction for a notification. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related topics but the structure of linking real-time failures to a separate, timed notification is slightly awkward. | 5 | The security mechanisms mentioned are valid and consistent with each other. | 4 | The intent is good but could provide more clarity on the purpose of the 11-hour notification (is it a summary, or just a timestamp?). | 4.4 | A clear and valid notification intent, using correct security terminology, with a minor awkwardness in its logical structure. |
| 26 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-deterministic performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols without compromising deterministic performance characteristics. | 3 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. However, `256_NEA1` is an incorrect identifier. 3GPP NAS Encryption Algorithms (NEA) are 128-bit. This is a significant standards alignment error. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying authentication and encryption methods while also imposing a qualitative constraint on "deterministic performance." | 5 | Despite the factual error, the sentence is well-formed and its intended meaning is clear. | 5 | The description's goal to "Secure... infrastructure" while maintaining performance is a core Performance Assurance task. | 5 | The intent logically connects the implementation of security measures with the need to preserve performance characteristics. | 4 | The use of a non-existent `256_NEA1` algorithm is inconsistent with 3GPP standards. | 5 | The intent clearly states the required security mechanisms and the performance constraint to be upheld. | 4.4 | A well-structured intent that is fundamentally flawed by its reference to a non-standard and incorrect 3GPP security algorithm. |
| 27 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 17hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | Certificate-based authentication is valid, and 128-NEA2 is a standard 5G NAS encryption algorithm defined in TS 33.501. The terminology is correct. | 4 | The intent defines multiple alert triggers based on security events and includes a timed notification for a related management action. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased and easy to understand. | 5 | The directive "Alert on" directly corresponds to the intent type. | 4 | The intent logically groups security monitoring but the connection between real-time failure events and a separate, scheduled notification could be smoother. | 5 | All specified security mechanisms are standard and consistent. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers and timing but could be clearer on the content or purpose of the 17-hour notification. | 4.6 | A strong and standards-aligned notification intent, with only a minor awkwardness in how it links different types of security notifications. |
| 28 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 66 core utilization and 195GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This request correctly targets the AMF and uses standard performance metrics (core/memory utilization) that are key to managing 5G NFs. | 4 | The intent is complex, requiring a specific type of report ("deterministic performance"), analysis of multiple metrics, and actionable recommendations. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and well-structured for easy parsing by a management system. | 5 | "Generate... report" is a direct instruction that perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, outlining the report type, its subject, the data to be analyzed, and the desired outcome. | 5 | All elements of the request are internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary information to generate the specified report. | 4.9 | An excellent and well-formed intent for requesting a detailed and actionable performance report on a critical 5G network function. |
| 29 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 1.33ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are standard 3GPP QoS parameters (TS 23.501). The values are specific and plausible. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies multiple QoS parameters (bitrate, delay) and priority for a new service launch. | 5 | The description is clear and easy to understand. | 5 | "Launch... network service" is a clear deployment action. | 3 | There is a significant internal contradiction between labeling the service "low priority" and simultaneously stating it supports "mission-critical applications" with a "strict 1.33ms" delay. | 3 | The contradiction between "low priority" and "mission-critical" with a very strict PDB makes the intent inconsistent. Low priority services would not typically get such guarantees. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key performance characteristics for the service launch. | 4.3 | A technically specific intent that is severely undermined by a major logical contradiction between its priority level and its performance requirements. |
| 30 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate UPF deployment through nfvo_4b6e8860c122 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_d817e37ddefa VNF Manager integration. | 5 | The intent correctly uses terminology from the ETSI NFV MANO framework (NFVO, VNFM), which is foundational for orchestrating 5G network functions like the UPF. | 4 | The intent is complex because it specifies the exact orchestrator and manager instances by their unique IDs, indicating a precise, targeted action in a complex environment. | 5 | The description is exceptionally clear, precise, and machine-readable, perfect for an automated system. | 5 | The action "Coordinate UPF deployment" is a direct fit for the Deployment Intent type. | 5 | The intent logically and accurately reflects the standard workflow where an NFVO instructs a VNFM to carry out a deployment. | 5 | The roles and interaction between the specified components are consistent with the ETSI MANO architecture. | 5 | For its level of abstraction, the intent is complete, clearly delegating the deployment task to the specified management entities. | 4.9 | An outstanding intent that accurately models a real-world, standards-based NFV orchestration command. It is clear, precise, and correct. |
| 31 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 21 core utilization and 315GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Targeting the AMF for a performance report using core and memory metrics is a standard and valid operational task in a 5G core network. | 4 | The request is complex, asking for analysis of specific metrics and the generation of actionable optimization advice. | 5 | The language is clear, unambiguous, and well-structured. | 5 | The opening phrase "Generate comprehensive... report" perfectly aligns the description with the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, logically specifying the report's subject, the data points for analysis, and the required output. | 5 | All elements of the request are consistent with one another. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the information needed to execute the reporting task. | 4.9 | An excellent, well-formed intent for a performance report. It is clear, complete, and directly actionable. |
| 32 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 51ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.005496 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and error rate (PER) are standard 3GPP QoS parameters. The intent uses these terms correctly. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the highly specific, non-round numerical values for both PDB and PER. | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the precise performance targets. | 5 | The intent to "Configure" specific performance parameters to assure quality is a perfect match for this intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently links the desired performance outcomes (delay, error rate) to the methods for achieving them. | 4 | The combination of a 51ms delay and the "mission-critical" label is questionable, as critical services typically demand lower latency, but it's not a direct contradiction. | 4 | The intent specifies the QoS targets well but is incomplete as it lacks the context of the slice or service these apply to. | 4.6 | A precise and standards-aligned performance intent, with a minor inconsistency in the use of "mission-critical" for the given latency. |
| 33 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect. 3GPP's NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm. This is a standards-alignment error. | 4 | The intent is complex, monitoring two distinct security event types and linking them to a timed notification for a third. | 5 | Despite the incorrect algorithm name, the sentence structure is clear and its intent is understandable. | 5 | The initial "Alert on" command clearly defines this as a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related events but the link between real-time failures and a scheduled notification is slightly disjointed. | 4 | The mention of the non-standard `256_NEA2` algorithm is inconsistent with 3GPP specifications. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could better specify the content of the 11-hour notification. | 4.1 | A clearly stated notification intent that is significantly flawed by the use of an incorrect/non-existent 3GPP security algorithm identifier. |
| 34 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect as 3GPP's NEA2 algorithm is 128-bit. This is a factual error against the standard. | 4 | The intent defines multiple trigger conditions based on different security events and a separate timed notification. | 5 | The sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear, despite the technical inaccuracy. | 5 | The directive "Alert on" makes the intent type clear. | 4 | The intent logically groups security events but the connection between failure alerts and a scheduled key rotation notification is slightly indirect. | 4 | The use of a non-standard `256_NEA2` identifier is inconsistent with 3GPP security specifications. | 4 | The triggers are clear, but the purpose of the 11-hour notification (e.g., summary vs. simple alert) is not fully specified. | 4.1 | This notification intent is clearly articulated but contains a significant error by referencing a non-standard 3GPP encryption algorithm. |
| 35 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 588ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a valid KPI. Using predictive analytics and automated remediation is aligned with advanced management concepts like ETSI ZSM and 3GPP NWDAF. | 4 | The intent specifies a precise performance target and links it to advanced operational methods (analytics, remediation). | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the performance goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The goal to "Optimize performance" to a specific target is a core example of this intent type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the desired outcome (588ms response time) with the enabling technologies. | 5 | All components of the intent are consistent with each other. | 4 | The intent is good but would be more complete if it specified the service or application to which this response time target applies. | 4.6 | A clear and well-defined intent for performance optimization using advanced automation, which could be improved by adding service context. |
| 36 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 12hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method for 5G, so its use is correct. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect; NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm as per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions for alerts and a separate timed notification about a related security event. | 5 | The request is clearly written and easy to understand, despite the technical error. | 5 | The "Alert on..." structure clearly indicates a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security events, but the link between the failure alerts and the scheduled notification is somewhat indirect. | 4 | The mention of `256_NEA2` is inconsistent with 3GPP standards, which specify 128-bit NAS encryption algorithms. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the triggers but could be more specific about the content of the 12-hour notification. | 4.1 | A notification intent with a correct reference to 5G-AKA but a significant flaw in its reference to a non-standard encryption algorithm. |
| 37 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 93 ARM64 processing cores at 2.13GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 4 | Requesting a feasibility check for deploying an AMF on specific ARM64-based hardware is a valid and realistic NFV scenario. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the highly specific core count and clock speed provided for the assessment. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. | 5 | The phrase "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, stating the goal and the primary constraints to consider. | 5 | The specified parameters are internally consistent and relevant to a hardware feasibility check. | 4 | The intent is very specific about CPU resources but omits memory, storage, and networking, which are also essential for a complete feasibility study. | 4.6 | A well-defined and specific intent for assessing compute resource feasibility, which would be more robust if it included memory and storage requirements. |
| 38 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Massive_MIMO_64T64R antenna systems with high-priority 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 98Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | All terms used are correct and standard in 5G NR technology: Massive MIMO 64T64R, 3D Beamforming, and backhaul capacity. | 5 | This intent is highly complex as it requests concurrent modifications to the RAN's antenna system, the beamforming algorithm, and the transport network's backhaul capacity. | 5 | The description is clear and specifies the exact modifications and their intended outcomes. | 5 | The verb "Reconfigure" places this intent squarely in the Modification category. | 5 | The intent logically connects the reconfiguration of RAN components to the enhancement of backhaul and the overall goal of improving performance. | 5 | The requested changes are complementary and consistent, all aiming to boost network capacity and coverage. | 5 | The intent is very complete, detailing the antenna type, beamforming method, and target backhaul capacity. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a complex, clear, and actionable intent for RAN modification and optimization. |
| 39 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 12hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA3 is a standard 5G NAS encryption algorithm (part of TS 33.501). All terminology is correct. | 4 | The intent is complex as it monitors for two different types of security events and includes a timed notification for a separate management action. | 5 | The request is clearly worded and easy to parse. | 5 | The "Alert on..." directive clearly aligns the intent with its type. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security events, but the structure linking real-time failure alerts to a scheduled notification could be more direct. | 5 | All specified security mechanisms are standard and consistent. | 4 | The triggers are well-defined, but the content and purpose of the 12-hour key rotation notification could be more explicit. | 4.6 | A strong, standards-aligned notification intent using correct 5G security terminology, with only a minor structural awkwardness. |
| 40 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 71 core utilization and 143GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on an AMF using core and memory metrics is a standard operational procedure aligned with 3GPP management functions. | 4 | The intent is complex, asking for a specific report with analysis of multiple metrics and actionable recommendations. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and unambiguous. | 5 | The "Generate... report" instruction is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, clearly stating the subject, metrics, and desired output of the report. | 5 | All elements of the request are internally consistent. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information to fulfill the reporting request completely. | 4.9 | An excellent example of a clear, complete, and actionable intent for generating a performance report. |
| 41 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2441-6327] | 4 | Throughput and latency are key performance indicators. "CPU_BASED scaling" is a common implementation strategy in NFV environments, though not a 3GPP-defined term itself. | 4 | The intent specifies concrete performance targets for both throughput and latency, and suggests a mechanism (CPU-based scaling) to achieve them. | 4 | The description is clear, but "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant. | 5 | The intent's goal is to achieve and maintain a specific level of network performance, which is the definition of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically links the desired performance outcomes (throughput, latency) to the proposed enforcement mechanism (scaling). | 5 | The goals of high throughput and low latency are consistent with a high-performance network. | 4 | The intent is good but could be more complete by specifying which service or data network this performance level applies to. | 4.4 | A strong performance intent with clear targets, slightly weakened by redundant phrasing. |
| 42 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps throughput capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2442-6344] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. "CPU_BASED scaling" is a valid, common implementation strategy for virtualized network functions. | 4 | The intent is complex as it defines specific numerical targets for both throughput and latency and points to a dynamic scaling mechanism. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and effectively communicates the performance objectives. | 5 | The goal to "Implement high-performance networking" to meet certain KPIs is a core performance assurance task. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the performance targets (throughput, latency) with the method to be used (CPU-based scaling). | 5 | The specified performance targets are consistent with a high-performance service. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the network slice or traffic flow that requires these performance characteristics. | 4.6 | A clear and well-formed intent for achieving specific performance targets through an autonomous scaling mechanism. |
| 43 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications monitoring with Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for deterministic performance degradation. [Instance-2443-6361] | 4 | URLLC is a standard 5G service category. Using anomaly detection for performance monitoring aligns with NWDAF principles. "Isolation_Forest" is an implementation-specific algorithm. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the service type (URLLC), monitoring goal, a specific ML algorithm, and the trigger condition (performance degradation). | 4 | The description is understandable but very dense. The repeated "ultra" is slightly awkward but common informal shorthand. | 5 | The core request is for monitoring and "proactive alerting," which falls under the notification category. | 5 | The intent logically connects the monitoring of a critical service (URLLC) with a specific detection method and a clear alerting trigger. | 5 | All concepts—URLLC, anomaly detection, and alerting on performance degradation—are consistent and form a coherent monitoring strategy. | 4 | The intent is very descriptive but could be more complete by defining the specific performance thresholds that constitute "degradation." | 4.6 | A sophisticated and complex intent for proactive monitoring of a URLLC service, using modern, relevant concepts. |
| 44 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 305Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with mission-critical 25.24ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 5 | Bitrate and latency are standard performance metrics. Analyzing feasibility against network topology and traffic patterns is a standard network planning and engineering task. | 4 | The intent is complex, requiring analysis of multiple specific performance constraints against dynamic network conditions. | 5 | The description is clear, precise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The request to "Analyze... feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently frames the feasibility question, specifying the performance targets and the key factors to consider in the analysis. | 4 | The term "ultra-low latency" is typically associated with <10ms, making 25.24ms an outlier. It's not a direct contradiction, but it is inconsistent with the common definition of URLLC. | 4 | The intent is good but would be more complete if it specified the intended service or application for this performance profile. | 4.6 | A clear and well-defined feasibility check, with a minor inconsistency in the use of "ultra-low latency" for the specified value. |
| 45 | Modification Intent | "Update QoS flow 5QI_80_Low_Latency_eMBB configuration with 5203Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality." | 4 | 5QI values are a standard 3GPP concept for QoS. However, 5QI 80 is defined for mission-critical data, not "Low_Latency_eMBB." This shows a slight misunderstanding of the standard 5QI table (TS 23.501). | 4 | The intent is complex as it targets a specific QoS flow identifier (5QI) and requests a modification to its maximum bitrate parameter. | 5 | The description is clear, specific, and easily parsable. | 5 | The request to "Update... configuration" is a clear modification action. | 5 | The intent logically connects the update action to the specific configuration item and the desired outcome. | 4 | There is an inconsistency between the specified 5QI 80 (for mission-critical services) and the name given "Low_Latency_eMBB." | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could also specify other QoS parameters like GBR or PDB to go with the MBR update. | 4.4 | A very clear and specific intent that is slightly flawed by an incorrect mapping between the standard 5QI value and its descriptive name. |
| 46 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 16Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 1.0ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are standard 3GPP QoS parameters. The values (16Mbps, 1.0ms) are consistent with a URLLC-type service. | 5 | The intent is complex, defining multiple strict QoS parameters and a high priority level for a new service deployment. | 4 | The readability is slightly impacted by the repetitive use of "mission-critical" and "critical." | 5 | "Launch... network service" is a clear deployment action. | 5 | The intent coherently specifies all the key performance characteristics required for the new service. | 5 | All specified parameters—critical priority, guaranteed bitrate, and a very low 1ms PDB—are consistent with a mission-critical URLLC service. | 5 | The intent is complete for defining the core SLA of the service to be launched. | 4.9 | An excellent and technically sound intent for deploying a URLLC-type service, with minor redundancy in its wording. |
| 47 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method. `256_NEA1` is an incorrect identifier, as 3GPP's NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm. This is a standards error. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct security failure conditions as triggers and links them to a scheduled notification about a third event. | 5 | Despite the technical error, the sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly defines the intent as a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related topics, but the structure linking real-time failures to a separate, timed notification is slightly awkward. | 4 | The name `256_NEA1` is inconsistent with the 3GPP standard for the NEA1 algorithm. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers clearly but could be more explicit about the content of the 9-hour notification. | 4.1 | A clear notification intent that is undermined by a significant factual error in the name of the specified security algorithm. |

| 49 | Deployment Intent | "Provision edge computing resources featuring 18 processing cores and 25GB memory allocation, optimized for distributed computing workloads and real-time data analytics." | 5 | The provisioning of resources for edge computing is a key aspect of 5G, particularly for Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC).

| 50 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 228446_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and EAP_TLS/128_NEA3 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 5 | Device density is a key requirement for mMTC use cases in 5G. EAP-TLS and 128-NEA3 are standard 5G security protocols. Analyzing their overhead is a valid engineering task. | 5 | This is a highly complex feasibility check, requiring analysis of system capacity under massive load while also factoring in the performance overhead of specific security protocols. | 5 | The description is clear and specifies the exact factors to be considered in the analysis. | 5 | The request to "Consider... impact" is a form of feasibility analysis. | 5 | The intent logically combines two critical aspects of a massive IoT deployment: device density and security overhead. | 5 | High device density and the need for robust security are consistent and realistic requirements for an mMTC scenario. | 5 | The intent is complete, clearly stating the density and security parameters to be evaluated. | 5.0 | An excellent, highly relevant, and complex intent for assessing the feasibility of a massive IoT deployment, perfectly aligning with 5G capabilities and challenges. |

| 53 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 15hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | 5G-AKA is the correct primary authentication method for 5G. However, `256_NEA1` is incorrect, as NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm. This is a standards-alignment error. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct security failure conditions as triggers and links them to a scheduled notification about a third event. | 5 | Despite the technical error, the sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly defines the intent as a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related topics, but the structure linking real-time failures to a separate, timed notification is slightly awkward. | 4 | The name `256_NEA1` is inconsistent with the 3GPP standard for the NEA1 algorithm. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers clearly but could be more explicit about the content of the 15-hour notification. | 4.1 | A clear notification intent that is undermined by a significant factual error in the name of the specified security algorithm. |

| 57 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2457-6430] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. "CPU_BASED scaling" is a valid implementation strategy for virtualized network functions. The term "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant. | 4 | The intent is complex as it defines specific numerical targets for both throughput and latency and points to a dynamic scaling mechanism. | 4 | The phrasing is clear and understandable, but the repetition of "high-throughput high-capacity" is poor style. | 5 | The goal to achieve and maintain a specific level of network performance fits the Performance Assurance type perfectly. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the performance targets (throughput, latency) with the method to be used (CPU-based scaling). | 5 | The specified performance targets are consistent with a high-performance service. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the network slice or traffic flow that requires these performance characteristics. | 4.4 | A strong performance intent with clear targets, slightly weakened by redundant phrasing. |
| 58 | Deployment Intent | "Secure network infrastructure using fault-tolerant continuous_behavioral_authentication continuous identity verification and hardware_based_attestation hardware-based device attestation, implementing zero-trust security architecture principles." | 4 | While Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a modern security paradigm highly relevant to 5G, the specific terms like "continuous_behavioral_authentication" are more conceptual or implementation-specific than direct 3GPP standard terms. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, referencing an advanced security architecture (ZTA) and multiple sophisticated techniques like behavioral authentication and hardware attestation. | 4 | The description is mostly clear but contains some redundancy ("continuous_behavioral_authentication continuous identity verification"). | 4 | This feels more like a Security or Policy intent. However, implementing these foundational security measures is often part of the initial infrastructure deployment, making the classification acceptable. | 5 | The intent coherently links specific security techniques to the overarching goal of implementing a zero-trust architecture. | 5 | All the mentioned security concepts are consistent and work together to build a robust, modern security posture. | 4 | The intent is conceptual. For implementation, it would need to be broken down into more specific, actionable configurations on particular network components. | 4.4 | A forward-looking and conceptually strong intent for deploying a zero-trust security model, though it's high-level and uses some non-standard terminology. |
| 59 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 2hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 is a valid (though legacy 4G) 3GPP encryption algorithm.

The 2-hour rotation for a "mission-critical" context is also consistent. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could clarify the relationship between the failures and the 2-hour notification. | 4.4 | A solid and clear notification intent using valid security terms, with a minor awkwardness in its structure. |

| 66 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 285days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | While NWDAF (TS 23.288) supports analytics, specifying a "Genetic_Algorithm" is an implementation detail, not a standards-based declarative intent. The concept is valid, but the phrasing is not ideal. | 5 | The intent describes a highly complex alerting mechanism involving a specific ML algorithm, fault tolerance, and very long-term historical analysis. | 4 | The description is mostly clear but uses abstract phrases like "intelligent insights" that reduce its direct applicability for automation. | 5 | The core action "Alert" aligns this intent perfectly with its type. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the components of the proposed alerting system: the algorithm, the data source, and the output type. | 5 | All elements are consistent and describe a plausible, if highly advanced, analytical alerting system. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it specifies the method of analysis but not the actual events or KPIs to be monitored. | 4.3 | A complex and forward-looking notification intent that is too focused on implementation details (the specific algorithm) and lacks concrete monitoring targets. |

It's not a contradiction, but it's an odd ratio. | 4 | The description "high-performance" and "mission-critical" is somewhat inconsistent with the very low memory allocation (1GB). | 4 | While it specifies the resources well, it's slightly incomplete as it doesn't name the specific network function to be deployed on them. | 4.3 | A clear deployment intent that is slightly weakened by an inconsistent description of the performance level for the given resource allocation. |

"Transport network optimization" is a valid but very high-level goal. | 3 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying the resource changes. | 4 | The first part of the intent is clear, but "with transport network optimization" is vague and lacks specific parameters. | 5 | The verb "Modify" clearly indicates the intent type. | 3 | The intent lacks coherence. It combines a very specific resource modification with a vague, unrelated goal for a different network domain (transport). It's not clear how they are connected. | 3 | The direct modification of compute resources is not directly linked to transport network optimization in this statement, making their combination inconsistent. | 3 | The "transport network optimization" part is highly incomplete and requires significant clarification. | 3.6 | A disjointed intent that combines a specific, actionable resource modification with a vague, unrelated, and incomplete goal. |

| 80 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Particle_Swarm intelligent insights with mission-critical 153days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | While NWDAF (TS 23.288) supports analytics, specifying "Particle_Swarm" optimization is an implementation detail, not a standards-based declarative intent. The concept is valid, but the phrasing is not ideal. | 5 | The intent describes a highly complex alerting mechanism involving a specific ML algorithm, fault tolerance, and long-term historical analysis. | 4 | The description is mostly clear but uses abstract phrases like "intelligent insights" that reduce its direct applicability for automation. | 5 | The core action "Alert" aligns this intent perfectly with its type. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the components of the proposed alerting system: the algorithm, the data source, and the output type. | 5 | All elements are consistent and describe a plausible, if highly advanced, analytical alerting system. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it specifies the method of analysis but not the actual events or KPIs to be monitored. | 4.3 | A complex and forward-looking notification intent that is too focused on implementation details (the specific algorithm) and lacks concrete monitoring targets. |
| 81 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with 1 ARM64 cores and 12GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Specifying compute resources (ARM64, DDR4) for network functions is a standard part of the NFV deployment process. | 3 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying core count, architecture, and memory size/type. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily understandable. | 5 | "Provision... compute resources" is a direct statement of a deployment action. | 3 | The resource allocation of 1 core and 12GB of memory is a highly unusual and imbalanced ratio for almost any network function. It's not a logical contradiction, but it is inconsistent with typical VNF profiles. | 4 | The description "high-performance" and "demanding" is inconsistent with the single processing core specified. | 4 | While it specifies the resources well, it's incomplete as it doesn't name the specific network function to be deployed on them. | 4.1 | A clear deployment intent that is significantly weakened by an unrealistic and imbalanced resource allocation. |

It is clear, precise, and correct. |
| 83 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 141ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.007949 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and error rate (PER) are standard 3GPP QoS parameters. The intent uses these terms correctly. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the highly specific, non-round numerical values for both PDB and PER. | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the precise performance targets. | 5 | The intent to "Configure" specific performance parameters to assure quality is a perfect match for this intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently links the desired performance outcomes (delay, error rate) to the methods for achieving them. | 4 | The combination of a 141ms delay and the "mission-critical" label is questionable, as critical services typically demand lower latency, but it's not a direct contradiction. | 4 | The intent specifies the QoS targets well but is incomplete as it lacks the context of the slice or service these apply to. | 4.6 | A precise and standards-aligned performance intent, with a minor inconsistency in the use of "mission-critical" for the given latency. |

[Instance-2484-6549] | 3 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect. 3GPP's NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm. This is a standards-alignment error. | 4 | The intent is complex, monitoring two distinct security event types and linking them to a timed notification for a third. | 5 | Despite the incorrect algorithm name, the sentence structure is clear and its intent is understandable. | 5 | The initial "Alert on" command clearly defines this as a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related events but the link between real-time failures and a scheduled notification is slightly disjointed. | 4 | The mention of the non-standard `256_NEA2` algorithm is inconsistent with 3GPP specifications. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could better specify the content of the 11-hour notification. | 4.1 | A clearly stated notification intent that is significantly flawed by the use of an incorrect/non-existent 3GPP security algorithm identifier. |
| 85 | Deployment Intent | "Secure multi-domain orchestration using HMAC_SHA256 key derivation functions with high-priority 256_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 15hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle." | 4 | HMAC-SHA256 is a standard and strong cryptographic algorithm.

This is a minor inconsistency in optimization strategy. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the antenna, beamforming type, and target backhaul capacity. | 4.9 | A very strong and clear modification intent, with a minor technical inconsistency in applying 3D beamforming to a 4T4R system. |
| 90 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 67 ARM64 processing cores at 3.53GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 4 | Requesting a feasibility check for deploying an AMF on specific ARM64-based hardware is a valid and realistic NFV scenario. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the highly specific core count and clock speed provided for the assessment. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. | 5 | The phrase "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, stating the goal and the primary constraints to consider. | 5 | The specified parameters are internally consistent and relevant to a hardware feasibility check. | 4 | The intent is very specific about CPU resources but omits memory, storage, and networking, which are also essential for a complete feasibility study. | 4.6 | A well-defined and specific intent for assessing compute resource feasibility, which would be more robust if it included memory and storage requirements. |
| 91 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 5hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method. `256_NEA1` is an incorrect identifier, as 3GPP's NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm. This is a standards error. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct security failure conditions as triggers and links them to a scheduled notification about a third event. | 5 | Despite the technical error, the sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly defines the intent as a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related topics, but the structure linking real-time failures to a separate, timed notification is slightly awkward. | 4 | The name `256_NEA1` is inconsistent with the 3GPP standard for the NEA1 algorithm. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers clearly but could be more explicit about the content of the 5-hour notification. | 4.1 | A clear notification intent that is undermined by a significant factual error in the name of the specified security algorithm. |
| 92 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 74 RISC_V processing cores at 1.8GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 4 | AMF is a valid 5G Network Function (NF). Specifying CPU architecture (RISC_V) and clock speed is a valid, low-level infrastructure consideration, aligned with NFV principles. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, mentioning core count, architecture (RISC_V), and a precise clock speed, which adds significant detail. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and grammatically correct, making it easy for both humans and automation to parse. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Assess...feasibility," which directly matches the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The request is structured logically, stating the goal (assess AMF deployment) and the specific constraints to consider. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions; all parameters are aligned with the goal of a hardware feasibility check. | 4 | The intent specifies core requirements but could be more complete by including memory or storage parameters for a full assessment. | 4.6 | This is a well-defined and technically specific intent for assessing the feasibility of deploying a 5G core function on particular hardware. |
| 93 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 108 core utilization and 215GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on an AMF using core and memory metrics is a standard operational procedure aligned with 3GPP management functions. | 4 | The intent is complex, asking for a specific report with analysis of multiple metrics and "mission-critical" actionable recommendations. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and unambiguous. | 5 | The "Generate... report" instruction is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, clearly stating the subject, metrics, and desired output of the report. | 5 | All elements of the request are internally consistent. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information to fulfill the reporting request completely. | 4.9 | An excellent example of a clear, complete, and actionable intent for generating a performance report. |
| 94 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 4minutes/12minutes/37minutes multi-tier escalation through Kafka notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | Using Kafka for notifications is a common, modern implementation choice. Multi-tier escalation is a standard operational procedure. These are not 3GPP-specific but are relevant. | 5 | The intent is complex, specifying a multi-stage escalation timeline with precise timings, the messaging system (Kafka), and an advanced routing mechanism. | 5 | The request is clear, precise, and easily understandable. | 5 | The request to "Implement" a notification and escalation procedure fits the intent type well. | 5 | The intent coherently describes a complete escalation workflow, from the timing tiers to the delivery mechanism. | 5 | All components—multi-tier escalation, Kafka, and intelligent routing—are consistent and form a robust notification system. | 4 | The intent is very specific about the "how" (Kafka, escalation times) but is incomplete as it doesn't state the "what" (i.e., which alerts or events trigger this escalation). | 4.7 | A strong and detailed intent for setting up an escalation procedure, which could only be improved by specifying the trigger events. |
| 95 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps throughput capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2495-6601] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. "CPU_BASED scaling" is a valid, common implementation strategy for virtualized network functions. | 4 | The intent is complex as it defines specific numerical targets for both throughput and latency and points to a dynamic scaling mechanism. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and effectively communicates the performance objectives. | 5 | The goal to "Implement high-performance networking" to meet certain KPIs is a core performance assurance task. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the performance targets (throughput, latency) with the method to be used (CPU-based scaling). | 5 | The specified performance targets are consistent with a high-performance service. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the network slice or traffic flow that requires these performance characteristics. | 4.6 | A clear and well-formed intent for achieving specific performance targets through an autonomous scaling mechanism. |
| 96 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 4hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | 5G-AKA is the correct primary authentication method for 5G. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect; NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm as per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions for alerts and a separate timed notification about a related security event. | 5 | The request is clearly written and easy to understand, despite the technical error. | 5 | The "Alert on..." structure clearly indicates a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security events, but the link between the failure alerts and the scheduled notification is somewhat indirect. | 4 | The mention of `256_NEA2` is inconsistent with 3GPP standards, which specify 128-bit NAS encryption algorithms. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the triggers but could be more specific about the content of the 4-hour notification. | 4.1 | A notification intent with a correct reference to 5G-AKA but a significant flaw in its reference to a non-standard encryption algorithm. |
| 97 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 32 RISC_V processing cores at 2.86GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 4 | AMF is a valid 5G Network Function (NF). Specifying CPU architecture (RISC_V) and clock speed is a valid, low-level infrastructure consideration, aligned with NFV principles. | 4 | The intent is technically specific, mentioning core count, architecture (RISC_V), and a precise clock speed, which adds significant detail. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and grammatically correct, making it easy for both humans and automation to parse. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Assess...feasibility," which directly matches the "Intent Feasibility Check" type. | 5 | The request is structured logically, stating the goal (assess AMF deployment) and the specific constraints to consider. | 5 | There are no internal contradictions; all parameters are aligned with the goal of a hardware feasibility check. | 4 | The intent specifies core requirements but could be more complete by including memory or storage parameters for a full assessment. | 4.6 | This is a well-defined and technically specific intent for assessing the feasibility of deploying a 5G core function on particular hardware. |
| 98 | Deployment Intent | "Monitor security events using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with high-priority 5minutes/13minutes/48minutes escalation policies, ensuring rapid response to security incidents." | 4 | The use of anomaly detection for security monitoring is a valid, modern approach. Escalation policies are a standard operational concept. "Isolation_Forest" is an implementation detail. | 5 | The intent is complex, specifying the monitoring technique (a specific ML algorithm), a multi-tier escalation timeline, and the overarching goal. | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the requirements for the security monitoring system. | 4 | This sounds more like a "Policy Intent" or "Notification Intent" for an existing system. However, deploying a new monitoring service fits the Deployment category. | 5 | The intent coherently links the detection method to the response procedure (escalation) and the ultimate goal (rapid response). | 5 | The use of anomaly detection and a rapid escalation policy are consistent with modern security operations. | 4 | The intent is very clear on the "how" but is incomplete on the "what" – it doesn't specify which security events or data sources to monitor. | 4.6 | A strong and sophisticated intent for deploying a security monitoring capability, which could be improved by specifying the events to be monitored. |
| 99 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications monitoring with One_Class_SVM behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for deterministic performance degradation. [Instance-2499-6626] | 4 | URLLC is a standard 5G service category. Using anomaly detection for performance monitoring aligns with NWDAF principles. "One_Class_SVM" is an implementation-specific algorithm. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the service type (URLLC), monitoring goal, a specific ML algorithm, and the trigger condition (performance degradation). | 4 | The description is understandable but very dense. The repeated "ultra" is slightly awkward but common informal shorthand. | 5 | The core request is for monitoring and "proactive alerting," which falls under the notification category. | 5 | The intent logically connects the monitoring of a critical service (URLLC) with a specific detection method and a clear alerting trigger. | 5 | All concepts—URLLC, anomaly detection, and alerting on performance degradation—are consistent and form a coherent monitoring strategy. | 4 | The intent is very descriptive but could be more complete by defining the specific performance thresholds that constitute "degradation." | 4.6 | A sophisticated and complex intent for proactive monitoring of a URLLC service, using modern, relevant concepts. |
| 100 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 16 core utilization and 36GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The request to analyze AMF performance using core and memory metrics is a standard operational practice aligned with 3GPP management functions. | 4 | The intent is complex, calling for a specific type of report ("deterministic performance"), analysis of multiple metrics, and actionable recommendations. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable by a management system. | 5 | The action "Generate... report" directly corresponds to the intent type. | 5 | The intent is structured logically, defining the report type, its subject, the data for analysis, and the required outcome. | 5 | All elements of the request are internally consistent. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary details to generate the specified report. | 4.9 | An excellent and well-formed intent for requesting a detailed and actionable performance report. |
| 101 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 106GB HBM2 memory and 2896GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | The specified hardware (HBM2, NVMe_PCIe4) is realistic for high-performance NFV infrastructure (NFVI) hosting 5G functions, aligning with ETSI NFV standards. | 4 | The intent details specific memory/storage technologies and very large, precise capacities, indicating a high level of technical complexity. | 5 | The description is unambiguous and clearly states the components and analysis required. | 5 | The action "Evaluate memory and storage requirements" is a perfect example of a feasibility check. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, linking the hardware evaluation to the required performance impact analysis. | 5 | The specified components are consistent with a high-performance system, with no conflicting requirements. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't mention which network function or service the resources are for, which is critical for a "performance impact analysis." | 4.4 | This intent clearly specifies a feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but it lacks the necessary context of the workload for a complete analysis. |
| 102 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 23 core utilization and 330GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly targets the AMF for performance analysis and uses standard metrics (core/memory utilization), aligning with 3GPP management specifications. | 4 | This request is complex due to its specificity regarding the analysis metrics (core/memory usage) and the required output (optimization recommendations). | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable, making the requested action unambiguous. | 5 | The description's primary verb "Generate... report" perfectly aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, detailing the subject of the report (AMF), the specific data points for analysis, and the expected outcome. | 5 | The details are internally consistent and all contribute to the overarching goal of a performance report. | 5 | The intent is fully specified, leaving no doubt about which NF to analyze, what metrics to consider, and what the report should contain. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and actionable intent that effectively requests a detailed performance report for a critical 5G network function. |
| 103 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 27 x86_64 processing cores at 3.97GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 4 | Requesting a feasibility check for deploying an AMF on specific x86_64-based hardware is a very common and valid NFV scenario. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the highly specific core count and clock speed provided for the assessment. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. | 5 | The phrase "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, stating the goal and the primary constraints to consider. | 5 | The specified parameters are internally consistent and relevant to a hardware feasibility check. | 4 | The intent is very specific about CPU resources but omits memory, storage, and networking, which are also essential for a complete feasibility study. | 4.6 | A well-defined and specific intent for assessing compute resource feasibility, which would be more robust if it included memory and storage requirements. |
| 104 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure deterministic performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 128_NEA1 encryption with 15hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 is a valid (though legacy 4G) 3GPP encryption algorithm. The concepts align with 3GPP security standards. | 4 | The intent defines multiple security mechanisms and a specific key management policy, making it complex. | 5 | The description is clear and specifies the desired security mechanisms and management policy. | 5 | The description aims to "Secure... assurance," which directly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically groups together related security mechanisms (authentication, encryption, key management) to achieve a secure state. | 5 | The chosen security methods are compatible and work together to provide a consistent security posture. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could be more complete by linking these security settings to a specific service, slice, or network domain. | 4.6 | A strong and clear intent for configuring a specific security posture as part of a performance assurance strategy. |
| 105 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Particle_Swarm intelligent insights with mission-critical 25days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | While NWDAF (TS 23.288) supports analytics, specifying "Particle_Swarm" optimization is an implementation detail, not a standards-based declarative intent. The concept is valid, but the phrasing is not ideal. | 5 | The intent describes a highly complex alerting mechanism involving a specific ML algorithm, fault tolerance, and long-term historical analysis. | 4 | The description is mostly clear but uses abstract phrases like "intelligent insights" that reduce its direct applicability for automation. | 5 | The core action "Alert" aligns this intent perfectly with its type. | 5 | The intent coherently describes the components of the proposed alerting system: the algorithm, the data source, and the output type. | 5 | All elements are consistent and describe a plausible, if highly advanced, analytical alerting system. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it specifies the method of analysis but not the actual events or KPIs to be monitored. | 4.3 | A complex and forward-looking notification intent that is too focused on implementation details (the specific algorithm) and lacks concrete monitoring targets. |
| 106 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2506-6684] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. "CPU_BASED scaling" is a valid implementation strategy for virtualized network functions. The term "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant. | 4 | The intent is complex as it defines specific numerical targets for both throughput and latency and points to a dynamic scaling mechanism. | 4 | The phrasing is clear and understandable, but the repetition of "high-throughput high-capacity" is poor style. | 5 | The goal to achieve and maintain a specific level of network performance fits the Performance Assurance type perfectly. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the performance targets (throughput, latency) with the method to be used (CPU-based scaling). | 5 | The specified performance targets are consistent with a high-performance service. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the network slice or traffic flow that requires these performance characteristics. | 4.4 | A strong performance intent with clear targets, slightly weakened by redundant phrasing. |
| 107 | Modification Intent | "Update QoS flow 5QI_1_Conversational_Voice configuration with mission-critical 6081Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality." | 4 | 5QI 1 is the correct, standardized identifier for Conversational Voice. However, a maximum bitrate of 6081 Mbps (6 Gbps) is astronomically high and inconsistent with a voice service. This is a major consistency issue. | 4 | The intent is complex as it targets a specific, standardized QoS flow (5QI 1) and modifies a key parameter (maximum bitrate). | 5 | The description is clear, specific, and easily parsable. | 5 | The verb "Update" makes it a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the update action to the specific configuration item and the desired outcome. | 1 | The requested maximum bitrate of over 6 Gbps is completely inconsistent with the nature of a conversational voice service (which is typically <100 kbps). This makes the intent nonsensical. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete in terms of the modification action itself. | 4.1 | A structurally sound and clear intent that is rendered useless by a wildly inconsistent and unrealistic parameter value for the specified service. |
| 108 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 43GB HBM2 memory and 5887GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | The specified hardware (HBM2, NVMe_PCIe4) is realistic for high-performance NFV infrastructure (NFVI) hosting 5G functions, aligning with ETSI NFV standards. | 4 | The intent details specific memory/storage technologies and very large, precise capacities, indicating a high level of technical complexity. | 5 | The description is unambiguous and clearly states the components and analysis required. | 5 | The action "Evaluate memory and storage requirements" is a perfect example of a feasibility check. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, linking the hardware evaluation to the required performance impact analysis. | 5 | The specified components are consistent with a high-performance system, with no conflicting requirements. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't mention which network function or service the resources are for, which is critical for a "performance impact analysis." | 4.4 | This intent clearly specifies a feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but it lacks the necessary context of the workload for a complete analysis. |
| 109 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 367GB LPDDR5 memory and 9391GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | LPDDR5 and NVMe_PCIe4 are valid, modern hardware technologies suitable for NFV infrastructure, consistent with the underlying requirements for hosting 5G functions. | 4 | Specifies exact types and sizes of memory and storage, making it a detailed and complex technical request. | 5 | The description is clear and easy to understand, specifying exactly what needs to be evaluated. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the subject "requirements" directly align with the purpose of a feasibility check. | 5 | The request is coherent, linking the evaluation of specific hardware to a required performance impact analysis. | 4 | The combination of low-power LPDDR5 RAM with high-performance NVMe storage is unusual for a server environment but technically possible and not a direct contradiction. | 3 | Like a similar previous intent, it's incomplete because it lacks the context of the NF or workload, which is essential for a meaningful performance impact analysis. | 4.3 | A specific hardware feasibility check that is well-written, but its practical value is limited by the absence of workload context. |
| 110 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 946Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 26.8ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are standard 3GPP QoS parameters (TS 23.501). The values are specific and plausible. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies multiple QoS parameters (bitrate, delay) and priority for a new service launch. | 5 | The description is clear and easy to understand. | 5 | "Launch... network service" is a clear deployment action. | 3 | There is a significant internal contradiction between labeling the service "low priority" and simultaneously stating it supports "mission-critical applications." | 3 | The contradiction between "low priority" and "mission-critical" makes the intent inconsistent. Low priority services would not be used for mission-critical applications. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key performance characteristics for the service launch. | 4.3 | A technically specific intent that is severely undermined by a major logical contradiction between its priority level and its application support. |
| 111 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 12hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-2511-6711] | 3 | EAP-TLS is valid. However, `256_NEA1` is incorrect. 3GPP's NEA1 algorithm is 128-bit. This is a standards error. | 4 | The intent is complex as it monitors two distinct security event types and links them to a timed notification for a third. | 5 | Despite the incorrect algorithm name, the sentence structure is clear and its intent is understandable. | 5 | The initial "Alert on" command clearly defines this as a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related events but the link between real-time failures and a scheduled notification is slightly disjointed. | 4 | The mention of the non-standard `256_NEA1` algorithm is inconsistent with 3GPP specifications. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete but could better specify the content of the 12-hour notification. | 4.1 | A clearly stated notification intent that is significantly flawed by the use of an incorrect/non-existent 3GPP security algorithm identifier. |
| 112 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 94 core utilization and 95GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on an AMF using core and memory metrics is a standard operational procedure aligned with 3GPP management functions. | 4 | The intent is complex, asking for a specific report with analysis of multiple metrics and actionable recommendations. | 5 | The description is clear, concise, and unambiguous. | 5 | The "Generate... report" instruction is a perfect match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, clearly stating the subject, metrics, and desired output of the report. | 5 | All elements of the request are internally consistent. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information to fulfill the reporting request completely. | 4.9 | An excellent example of a clear, complete, and actionable intent for generating a performance report. |
| 113 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 7hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | Certificate-based authentication is valid, and 128-NEA2 is a standard 5G NAS encryption algorithm defined in TS 33.501. The terminology is correct. | 4 | The intent defines multiple alert triggers based on security events and includes a timed notification for a related management action. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased and easy to understand. | 5 | The directive "Alert on" directly corresponds to the intent type. | 4 | The intent logically groups security monitoring but the connection between real-time failure events and a separate, scheduled notification could be smoother. | 5 | All specified security mechanisms are standard and consistent. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers and timing but could be clearer on the content or purpose of the 7-hour notification. | 4.6 | A strong and standards-aligned notification intent, with only a minor awkwardness in how it links different types of security notifications. |
| 114 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy sophisticated HMAC_SHA256 key derivation functions utilizing 256_bit cryptographic keys with mission-critical automated 6hours rotation intervals, ensuring continuous security posture and cryptographic freshness." | 4 | HMAC-SHA256 is a standard algorithm. The concepts are valid and highly relevant to network security. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying the algorithm, key size, and a strict, automated rotation policy. | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the security requirements. | 4 | This is arguably a Security or Policy intent. However, deploying a new security configuration can be classed as a deployment action. | 5 | The intent logically connects the specific security mechanisms to the high-level goal of ensuring security posture. | 5 | All specified parameters—HMAC-SHA256, 256-bit keys, and a 6-hour rotation—are consistent for a high-security environment. | 5 | The intent is complete for defining the parameters of this security policy. | 4.7 | A strong, clear, and technically detailed intent for deploying a robust security policy. |
| 115 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-deterministic performance networking achieving 1000Mbps throughput capacity and 5ms ultra-low ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2515-6740] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs. The concepts are correct, though "ultra-low ultra-low" is stylistically poor. | 4 | The intent is complex, defining specific numerical targets for throughput and latency and mentioning a dynamic scaling mechanism. | 3 | The description is mostly clear, but the repetition "ultra-low ultra-low latency" is redundant and unprofessional. | 5 | The goal to "Implement... networking" to achieve certain KPIs is a core performance assurance task. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the performance targets with the method to be used (CPU-based scaling). | 5 | The specified performance targets are consistent with a high-performance service. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified the network slice or traffic flow that requires these performance characteristics. | 4.3 | A good performance intent that is clear in its goals but marred by poor, repetitive wording. |
| 116 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 23hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | 5G-AKA is the correct primary authentication method for 5G. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect; NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm as per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple trigger conditions for alerts and a separate timed notification about a related security event. | 5 | The request is clearly written and easy to understand, despite the technical error. | 5 | The "Alert on..." structure clearly indicates a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security events, but the link between the failure alerts and the scheduled notification is somewhat indirect. | 4 | The mention of `256_NEA2` is inconsistent with 3GPP standards, which specify 128-bit NAS encryption algorithms. | 4 | The intent clearly defines the triggers but could be more specific about the content of the 23-hour notification. | 4.1 | A notification intent with a correct reference to 5G-AKA but a significant flaw in its reference to a non-standard encryption algorithm. |
| 117 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 128_NEA2 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics. | 5 | Certificate-based authentication is valid, and 128-NEA2 is a standard 5G NAS encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). The terminology is correct. | 4 | The intent combines specific security protocol requirements with a qualitative performance constraint. | 3 | The description has a typo/grammatical error: "high-priorityout compromising," which should likely be "without compromising." This damages readability for automation. | 5 | The intent to "Secure high-performance infrastructure" is a perfect fit for the Performance Assurance type. | 5 | Assuming the typo is corrected, the intent coherently links the implementation of specific security protocols to the overarching goal of maintaining performance. | 5 | The chosen security protocols are standard and consistent with securing a 5G network. | 5 | The intent is complete, stating the required security mechanisms and the associated performance constraint. | 4.6 | A very well-formed intent that is unfortunately spoiled by a significant typo, which would cause issues for automated parsing. |
| 118 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps throughput deterministic performance drops below thresholds or 5ms ultra-low latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-2518-6760] | 5 | Throughput and latency are standard KPIs used for performance monitoring and SLA enforcement in 3GPP networks. | 4 | The intent is complex, defining specific trigger conditions for two different performance metrics and linking them to an automated action (escalation). | 5 | The description is very clear, well-structured, and easy to parse, defining the conditions and actions precisely. | 5 | The core request is to "Alert" based on performance degradation, which is a perfect fit for this intent type. | 5 | The intent is perfectly coherent, using a clear "if-then" logical structure for the alerts (if performance drops, then escalate). | 5 | The performance metrics (high throughput, low latency) are consistent with a high-performance service, and alerting on their degradation is logical. | 4 | The intent is very good but could be more complete by specifying the exact threshold values for throughput and latency. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and actionable intent for performance-based alerting, slightly incomplete due to the lack of specific threshold values. |
| 119 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 2hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the correct primary authentication method for 5G, and 128-NEA2 is a correct 5G NAS encryption algorithm from TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct security failure conditions as triggers and links them to a scheduled notification about a third event. | 5 | The sentence is clear, grammatically correct, and easy to parse. | 5 | "Alert on..." clearly defines the intent as a notification request. | 4 | The intent coherently groups security-related topics, but the structure linking real-time failures to a separate, timed notification is slightly awkward. | 5 | The security mechanisms mentioned are valid and consistent with each other. The 2-hour rotation period is consistent with a "mission-critical" context. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers clearly but could be more explicit about the content of the 2-hour notification. | 4.6 | A clear, standards-aligned notification intent with a minor awkwardness in its logical structure. |

| 123 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 16hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method, and 128-NEA3 is a standard 5G NAS encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). The terminology is correct. | 4 | The intent defines multiple alert triggers based on security events and includes a timed notification for a related management action. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased and easy to understand. | 5 | The directive "Alert on" directly corresponds to the intent type. | 4 | The intent logically groups security monitoring but the connection between real-time failure events and a separate, scheduled notification could be smoother. | 5 | All specified security mechanisms are standard and consistent. | 4 | The intent specifies the triggers and timing but could be clearer on the content or purpose of the 16-hour notification. | 4.6 | A strong and standards-aligned notification intent, with only a minor awkwardness in how it links different types of security notifications. |
| 124 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure deterministic performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with high-priority 20hours automated key management. | 3 | EAP-TLS is valid. However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect. 3GPP's NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm. This is a standards-alignment error. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying authentication and encryption methods and a key management schedule. | 5 | Despite the factual error, the sentence is well-formed and its intended meaning is clear. | 5 | The description's goal to "Secure... assurance" while managing keys fits the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the implementation of security measures with the need to preserve performance characteristics. | 4 | The use of a non-existent `256_NEA2` algorithm is inconsistent with 3GPP standards. | 5 | The intent clearly states the required security mechanisms and the performance constraint to be upheld. | 4.4 | A well-structured intent that is fundamentally flawed by its reference to a non-standard and incorrect 3GPP security algorithm. |
| 125 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 6hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method, and 128-NEA1 is a valid 3GPP encryption algorithm.

| 128 | Modification Intent | Adjust Massive_MIMO_32T32R radio parameters and Vertical_Beamforming beamforming configuration with core network coordination. | 5 | Massive MIMO 32T32R and Vertical Beamforming are standard 5G NR concepts. The need for coordination with the core network for certain radio changes is also a valid operational reality. | 4 | The intent is complex, touching upon both RAN parameter adjustment and cross-domain (RAN-Core) coordination. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but "radio parameters" and "core network coordination" are vague and would require further specification for automation. | 5 | The verb "Adjust" clearly signals a modification. | 5 | The intent logically groups the adjustment of related RAN technologies and correctly identifies the need for coordination with another domain. | 5 | The components are consistent; Massive MIMO and Vertical Beamforming are used together, and RAN changes can impact the core. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It fails to specify which "radio parameters" to adjust or what kind of "coordination" is needed. | 4.4 | A conceptually sound intent that correctly identifies the need for cross-domain coordination but is too vague for direct implementation. |
| 129 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant One_Class_SVM anomaly detection with mission-critical 30% data sampling over 134days retention period. | 4 | Using anomaly detection for analytics aligns with NWDAF concepts.

| 130 | Deployment Intent | "Instantiate production-ready High_Performance_Storage_Optimized configuration utilizing Kubernetes container orchestration with mission-critical Airflow workflow automation, providing seamless lifecycle management and automated scaling capabilities." | 4 | This intent describes the deployment of a workload on a CaaS (Container as a Service) platform. Kubernetes is the de facto standard for this and is used for 5G NFs. Airflow is a common workflow tool. These are implementation technologies, not 3GPP standards. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying the configuration profile, the container orchestrator (Kubernetes), a workflow automation tool (Airflow), and high-level management goals. | 5 | The description is clear and uses correct terminology for modern cloud-native deployment. | 5 | "Instantiate" is a synonym for deploy, making the intent type correct. | 5 | The intent logically connects the deployment of a specific configuration with the tools and platforms used to manage it. | 5 | Kubernetes and Airflow are often used together and are consistent tools for achieving the stated goals of lifecycle management and automated scaling. | 4 | The intent is very specific about the platform but is incomplete as it doesn't state what application or network function is being deployed. | 4.7 | An excellent, modern, and cloud-native deployment intent that clearly specifies the "how" and the platform, but omits the "what" (the application). |
| 131 | Modification Intent | "Update QoS flow 5QI_84_Intelligent_Transport_Systems configuration with 5637Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality." | 4 | 5QI 84 is the correct, standardized identifier for V2X messages (part of Intelligent Transport Systems). However, a maximum bitrate of 5.6 Gbps is extremely high for V2X messages, which are typically small. | 4 | The intent is complex as it targets a specific, standardized QoS flow (5QI 84) and modifies a key parameter (maximum bitrate). | 5 | The description is clear, specific, and easily parsable. | 5 | The verb "Update" makes it a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the update action to the specific configuration item and the desired outcome. | 2 | The requested maximum bitrate of over 5 Gbps is inconsistent with the typical traffic profile of Intelligent Transport Systems (V2X), which involves frequent, small messages. | 4 | The intent is mostly complete in terms of the modification action itself. | 4.1 | A structurally sound and clear intent that is significantly flawed by an inconsistent and unrealistic parameter value for the specified service. |

It also mixes concepts like "ultra-reliable" (URLLC) with "massive connectivity" (mMTC). | 5 | "Execute... deployment" is a clear deployment action. | 4 | The intent is mostly coherent but creates some confusion by mixing terminology from different service types (mMTC and URLLC). | 4 | There is an inconsistency. mMTC focuses on massive numbers of low-power devices, while URLLC focuses on high reliability. The intent mixes these ("ultra-reliable massive connectivity"), which are usually addressed by different slice types. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key architectural and radio components. | 4.6 | A strong deployment intent using correct terminology, but it is slightly weakened by a confusing mix of concepts from different 5G service types (mMTC and URLLC). |

Specifying algorithms like LSTM Autoencoder and Neural Networks are implementation details, not standards. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying multiple, distinct ML techniques (anomaly detection and prediction) for proactive performance management. | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the desired analytical capabilities. | 5 | The goal to "Monitor network performance" to "enable proactive performance management" is a core tenet of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent coherently combines different ML approaches to build a comprehensive performance management system. | 5 | The use of both anomaly detection and predictive analytics is a consistent and powerful combination. | 4 | The intent is conceptually strong but lacks specifics on which KPIs or services to monitor. | 4.7 | A sophisticated and clear intent for implementing an advanced, analytics-driven performance management system. |

This is a minor inconsistency in optimization strategy. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the antenna, beamforming type, and target backhaul capacity. | 4.9 | A very strong and clear modification intent, with a minor technical inconsistency in applying 3D beamforming to a 4T4R system. |
| 135 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 2hours key rotation event notifications. | 3 | EAP-AKA' is a valid authentication method. `256_NEA1` is an incorrect identifier, as 3GPP's NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm.

The values are specific and plausible. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies multiple QoS parameters (bitrate, delay) and priority for a new service launch. | 5 | The description is clear and easy to understand. | 5 | "Launch... network service" is a clear deployment action. | 3 | There is a significant internal contradiction between labeling the service "medium priority" and simultaneously stating it supports "mission-critical applications." | 3 | The contradiction between "medium priority" and "mission-critical" makes the intent inconsistent. Mission-critical applications would typically be assigned high priority. | 5 | The intent is complete in specifying the key performance characteristics for the service launch. | 4.3 | A technically specific intent that is severely undermined by a major logical contradiction between its priority level and its application support. |

| 145 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 183ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.007916 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and error rate (PER) are standard 3GPP QoS parameters. The intent uses these terms correctly. | 4 | The intent is complex due to the highly specific, non-round numerical values for both PDB and PER. | 5 | The description is clear and effectively communicates the precise performance targets. | 5 | The intent to "Configure" specific performance parameters to assure quality is a perfect match for this intent type. | 5 | The intent coherently links the desired performance outcomes (delay, error rate) to the methods for achieving them. | 4 | The combination of a 183ms delay and the "mission-critical" label is questionable, as critical services typically demand lower latency, but it's not a direct contradiction. | 4 | The intent specifies the QoS targets well but is incomplete as it lacks the context of the slice or service these apply to. | 4.6 | A precise and standards-aligned performance intent, with a minor inconsistency in the use of "mission-critical" for the given latency. |

However, `256_NEA2` is incorrect as 3GPP's NEA2 algorithm is 128-bit. This is a factual error against the standard. | 4 | The intent defines multiple trigger conditions based on different security events and a separate timed notification. | 5 | The sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear, despite the technical inaccuracy. | 5 | The directive "Alert on" makes the intent type clear. | 4 | The intent logically groups security events but the connection between failure alerts and a scheduled key rotation notification is slightly indirect. | 4 | The use of a non-standard `256_NEA2` identifier is inconsistent with 3GPP security specifications. | 4 | The triggers are clear, but the purpose of the 18-hour notification (e.g., summary vs. simple alert) is not fully specified. | 4.1 | This notification intent is clearly articulated but contains a significant error by referencing a non-standard 3GPP encryption algorithm. |
