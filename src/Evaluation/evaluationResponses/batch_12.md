| 1 | Performance Assurance Intent | Monitor network performance using fault-tolerant One_Class_SVM behavioral anomaly detection with mission-critical Neural_Network predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. | 4 | The application of ML models like One-Class SVM and Neural Networks for anomaly detection and prediction is aligned with 3GPP NWDAF concepts (TS 23.288), though the models themselves are not standardized terms. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying distinct ML models for different tasks (anomaly detection vs. prediction) and linking them to a high-level goal. | 4 | The sentence is well-structured and grammatically correct, though it is dense with technical jargon. | 5 | The description directly addresses the goal of performance assurance through monitoring and proactive management. | 5 | The components of the intent are logically connected, starting from the method (ML models) to the outcome (proactive management). | 5 | Using fault-tolerant anomaly detection with predictive analytics is a consistent and standard approach for proactive network assurance. | 3 | The intent is conceptually complete but lacks specific KPIs or network segments to monitor, making it a high-level goal rather than a precise instruction. | 4.4 | A strong, complex intent that clearly articulates a modern, ML-driven approach to performance assurance, though it lacks specific metrics. |
| 2 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 36 core utilization and 150GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent correctly identifies a 3GPP Network Function (AMF) and uses standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory consumption) as specified in documents like 3GPP TS 28.552. | 5 | The request is highly specific, detailing the NF, the exact metrics, resource values, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The sentence is clear, concise, and easily parsable by both a human operator and an automation engine. | 5 | The description is a direct and unambiguous request for a report, perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The request flows logically from the action (generate report) to the subject (AMF performance) and the desired outcome (recommendations). | 5 | Analyzing resource consumption to generate optimization recommendations is a perfectly consistent and logical workflow. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary details (what to analyze, which metrics, and what to produce) to be fully actionable. | 5.0 | An exemplary intent that is clear, specific, actionable, and perfectly aligned with 3GPP network management principles. |
| 3 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 21hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | The intent correctly uses standard security terms: EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA3 (AES in CTR mode) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence. They are two distinct notification types. | 3 | While the individual elements are related to security, combining failure-based alerting with time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.6 | A good intent using correct 3GPP security terminology, but its coherence and consistency are weakened by combining two different types of notifications. |
| 4 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 47 core utilization and 370GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | This aligns with 3GPP performance management standards (e.g., TS 28.552) by targeting a specific NF (AMF) with standard metrics (core, memory). The "deterministic" keyword correctly points to predictable performance, a key 5G concept. | 5 | The intent is very specific, providing the NF, precise resource values (47 cores, 370GB), the type of analysis (deterministic), and the expected output. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased, well-structured, and easy for an automation system to parse. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance report, perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The sentence structure is logical and clear, stating the action, subject, metrics, and desired outcome in a coherent sequence. | 5 | The goal of analyzing resource utilization to provide optimization recommendations is a consistent and logical management task. | 5 | This intent is fully specified and actionable, containing all the necessary parameters for execution. | 5.0 | An excellent and highly specific intent for a performance report, correctly using relevant terminology for deterministic networking. |
| 5 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 301ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the closed-loop automation concepts in 3GPP management frameworks (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (301ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it (predictive analytics, automated remediation). | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, stating a clear goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a target metric with enabling technologies like predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong, clear, and actionable intent that defines a specific performance goal and the high-level mechanisms to enforce it. |
| 6 | Performance Assurance Intent | Configure 175ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.008395 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms. | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER) are standardized QoS parameters in 3GPP, particularly for 5G QoS Flows (5QI) as defined in TS 23.501. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, providing exact numerical values for both PDB and error rate, and referencing the required underlying mechanisms. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, technically precise, and easily understandable for network engineers and automation systems. | 5 | This is a classic Performance Assurance Intent, as it aims to configure and guarantee specific QoS characteristics. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, linking the specific QoS parameters to the high-level mechanisms needed to enforce them. | 5 | The specified PDB and error rate are consistent parameters for defining a QoS level, and traffic engineering is the correct mechanism to achieve this. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing all the key parameters needed to configure a QoS policy for a service. | 5.0 | An outstanding intent that correctly and precisely uses standardized 3GPP QoS terminology to define a clear performance goal. |
| 7 | Deployment Intent | Execute research-grade sophisticated with mission-critical cutting-edge innovations ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications network slice deployment featuring Massive_MIMO_32T32R antenna systems with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated 3D_Beamforming beamforming capabilities across 700MHz/3.5GHz/28GHz spectrum bands, optimized for Urban_Macro coverage scenarios. | 5 | The technical terms used—URLLC, network slice, Massive MIMO, 3D Beamforming, spectrum bands (e.g., n28, n78, n257/258), and Urban Macro scenario—are all correct and central to 3GPP 5G standards. | 5 | The intent is extremely complex, specifying slice type, RAN technology, antenna configuration, beamforming type, multiple spectrum bands, and a deployment scenario. | 1 | The readability is extremely poor due to excessive, repetitive, and unparsable adjectives like "research-grade sophisticated" and "ultra-ultra-reliable". This is severe keyword stuffing. | 5 | Despite the poor readability, the core request is clearly about deploying a network slice, which matches the intent type. | 1 | The sentence structure is broken and convoluted by the redundant adjectives, making it incoherent and difficult to follow. | 4 | The technical components (e.g., Massive MIMO for URLLC) are consistent with each other, but the descriptive terms are chaotically applied. | 5 | The intent provides a very rich and complete set of technical parameters for a slice deployment. | 4.0 | A technically rich and standards-aligned intent that is rendered almost unusable by atrocious readability and coherence, likely due to flawed generation. |
| 8 | Deployment Intent | Implement Massive_MIMO_32T32R radio access network with high-priority 3D_Beamforming beamforming across 600MHz/1.8GHz/24GHz spectrum coordination. | 5 | Massive MIMO (32T32R), 3D Beamforming, and spectrum bands (aligning with n71, n3, n258/n261) are all standard 3GPP RAN concepts. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the antenna technology, beamforming technique, and multiple frequency bands for deployment. | 5 | The sentence is clear, concise, and technically precise, making it easy to understand and automate. | 5 | The description is a direct instruction to implement or deploy a specific RAN configuration, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, detailing the core technology and the parameters for its deployment. | 5 | All the specified technologies are complementary and consistent with a modern 5G RAN deployment strategy. | 4 | The intent is quite complete but could be improved by specifying the coverage scenario (e.g., Urban, Rural). | 4.7 | A very strong, clear, and technically sound deployment intent that specifies a modern 5G RAN configuration. |
| 9 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | The intent correctly uses standard security terms: EAP-TLS, and 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | It specifies multiple, distinct trigger conditions (auth failures, breaches) and a secondary notification concerning key rotation with a specific time. | 3 | Similar to a previous record, the phrasing combines a reactive alert with a proactive notification using "with," which can be ambiguous. | 5 | The intent's purpose is to request alerts and notifications, which is a perfect match for the intent type. | 3 | The sentence structure combines two distinct notification triggers (one reactive, one scheduled) in a slightly jumbled way, reducing coherence. | 3 | Combining failure-driven alerts and time-driven notifications in a single intent is functionally inconsistent, as they serve different purposes. | 3 | The intent specifies triggers but omits crucial details like the notification channel or recipients. | 3.6 | A valid notification request that uses correct security terms but is hampered by a slightly incoherent and inconsistent structure. |
| 10 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate SMF deployment through nfvo_e31a6e8580d3 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_0d21f6849fe7 VNF Manager integration. | 5 | This intent correctly references the SMF (a 3GPP 5G core NF), and the NFVO and VNFM, which are key components of the ETSI NFV MANO framework, widely adopted for 5G deployments. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies the NF to be deployed (SMF) and the specific management and orchestration entities (NFVO, VNFM) by their identifiers. | 5 | The sentence is very clear, well-structured, and directly consumable by an orchestration system. | 5 | This is a classic deployment intent, instructing the orchestration of a network function through a specific management framework. | 5 | The instruction is perfectly coherent, describing a standard workflow for deploying a virtualized network function. | 5 | The roles of SMF, NFVO, and VNFM are described in a way that is perfectly consistent with ETSI NFV architecture. | 4 | The intent is actionable but could be more complete by including configuration details for the SMF itself. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-aligned intent describing a typical VNF deployment process through an NFV orchestrator. |
| 11 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 66 core utilization and 171GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF and standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory) in line with 3GPP management specifications like TS 28.552. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, detailing the target NF, exact resource values to analyze, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 5 | The request is clear, unambiguous, and perfectly formatted for both human and machine interpretation. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a report, which perfectly matches the specified intent type. | 5 | The sentence is logically constructed, flowing from the action to the subject and the expected outcome. | 5 | The goal of analyzing resource usage to find optimization opportunities is a consistent and standard management practice. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary details to be considered fully actionable by a management system. | 5.0 | An ideal example of an intent report request: specific, clear, actionable, and perfectly aligned with standards. |
| 12 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 71 core utilization and 148GB memory consumption patterns with mission-critical detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent is well-aligned with 3GPP standards, correctly identifying the AMF, using standard metrics, and referencing "deterministic performance," a key 5G concept. | 5 | This is a highly complex and specific intent, providing the NF, precise resource figures (71 cores, 148GB), analysis type, and required output. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable, making it suitable for automation. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance analytics report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The intent is coherently structured, outlining the required action, its parameters, and the desired result in a logical flow. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of performance metrics to the goal of resource optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | Another perfect example of a well-formed intent, combining specificity, clarity, and correct use of 3GPP terminology. |
| 13 | Modification Intent | Update security configuration using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication methods and 24hours key rotation policies, strengthening security posture and compliance requirements. | 5 | EAP-AKA' (EAP-AKA Prime) is a standard authentication method for non-3GPP access to the 5G core, defined in 3GPP TS 33.501. Key rotation is a standard security practice. | 4 | The intent specifies the exact authentication method and a specific key rotation policy, making it reasonably complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, easy to understand, and states both the action and its justification ("strengthening security posture"). | 5 | The description clearly states an action to "Update security configuration," which perfectly matches the Modification Intent type. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, stating the change to be made and the high-level reason for it. | 5 | Using a strong authentication method like EAP-AKA' and implementing a regular key rotation policy are consistent security best practices. | 4 | The intent is actionable but could be more complete by specifying where this configuration should be applied (e.g., which network function or interface). | 4.7 | A strong, clear, and standards-aligned intent to modify a security configuration, demonstrating good practice. |
| 14 | Modification Intent | Adjust Traditional_MIMO_4T4R radio parameters and Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming configuration with mission-critical core network coordination. | 4 | Traditional MIMO (as opposed to Massive MIMO) and Horizontal Beamforming are valid RAN concepts. 4T4R is a standard antenna configuration. The need for coordination with the core network is also a valid concept. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies modifications to both antenna (MIMO) and beamforming parameters and requires coordination with another network domain (core). | 4 | The intent is reasonably clear, although "core network coordination" is a high-level requirement that would need further specification. | 5 | The description's focus on "Adjust...parameters" makes it a clear fit for the Modification Intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking the adjustment of radio parameters to the need for broader network coordination. | 5 | Adjusting RAN parameters like MIMO and beamforming is a consistent set of actions. The need for core network coordination is also plausible. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it does not specify which radio parameters to adjust or what the "core network coordination" entails. | 4.1 | A good intent that correctly identifies relevant RAN technologies for modification, but it lacks the specific details needed to be fully actionable. |
| 15 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 256_NEA1 encryption protocols with mission-criticalout compromising performance characteristics. | 4 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method in 5G (TS 33.501). However, 256-NEA1 is not a standard 5G algorithm; the standards define 128-bit algorithms (NEA1, NEA2, NEA3). 256-bit AES is valid, but the naming is non-standard. The typo "mission-criticalout" harms it. | 3 | The intent specifies authentication and encryption methods, linking security to performance, which adds complexity. | 2 | The sentence structure is broken by the typo "mission-criticalout compromising," making it hard to read and parse. | 5 | The intent focuses on securing infrastructure without compromising performance, which aligns with Performance Assurance. | 3 | The typo breaks the logical flow of the sentence, making it less coherent. | 3 | There is a potential inconsistency between demanding "high-performance" and using a non-standard (and likely more computationally expensive) 256-bit NAS encryption. | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the typo and the use of a non-standard algorithm name, which would require clarification. | 3.3 | This intent has a valid goal but is marred by a critical typo, a non-standard term for an encryption algorithm, and a potential inconsistency. |
| 16 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 128_NEA1 encryption with 11hours automated key management. | 5 | EAP-AKA' is a standard authentication method for non-3GPP access. 128-NEA1 (128-bit AES in CTR mode) is a standardized 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies the authentication method, encryption algorithm, and a specific policy for key management (11-hour automation). | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and easy to understand for both humans and automation systems. | 5 | The goal is to "secure performance assurance," which is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, listing the specific security mechanisms that will be used to achieve the assurance goal. | 5 | The components—strong authentication, strong encryption, and automated key management—are all consistent parts of a robust security posture. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could be more complete by stating where these security policies should be applied. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-compliant intent that effectively combines multiple security parameters into a single assurance goal. |
| 17 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Particle_Swarm intelligent insights with mission-critical 93days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | Particle Swarm Optimization is a metaheuristic algorithm, not directly a 3GPP concept. Applying it for "intelligent insights" is plausible in the context of NWDAF, but the phrasing is abstract. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a non-trivial analysis method (Particle Swarm), a long data retention period (93 days), and the type of notification (trend-based). | 3 | The phrase "using...Particle_Swarm intelligent insights" is somewhat vague and jargony, reducing readability. | 5 | The description is fundamentally a request to "Alert...for trend-based notifications," which clearly aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking the method of analysis (Particle Swarm on historical data) to the type of output (trend-based alerts). | 4 | The use of an optimization algorithm for generating "insights" for trend analysis is a consistent, if abstract, concept. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify what trends or KPIs should be monitored. | 3.7 | A conceptually interesting but abstract intent that lacks the specific metrics needed to be actionable. |
| 18 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 110 core utilization and 336GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Perfectly aligned with 3GPP management standards (e.g., TS 28.552) by specifying the AMF and standard resource metrics. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, providing the target NF, exact resource values (110 cores, 336GB), and the desired output. | 5 | The sentence is clear, well-structured, and easily parsable by an automation system. | 5 | This is a direct request for a report, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The request flows logically from action to subject to desired outcome. | 5 | Analyzing resource consumption to generate optimization recommendations is a consistent and standard workflow. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary parameters to be considered fully actionable. | 5.0 | Another flawless example of an intent report request: it is specific, clear, actionable, and standards-aligned. |
| 19 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 33 core utilization and 29GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Aligns perfectly with 3GPP management specifications (e.g., TS 28.552) by targeting the AMF with standard metrics. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, providing the NF, precise resource figures (33 cores, 29GB), and the expected output. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, making it ideal for automated processing. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The sentence is logically constructed, outlining the required action and its parameters clearly. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of resource metrics to the goal of optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed intent that serves as a perfect template for a resource performance report request. |
| 20 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize deterministic performance achieving 170ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI. The concepts of "deterministic performance," predictive analytics, and automated remediation are all aligned with advanced 5G network management (e.g., URLLC, NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (170ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it, including a focus on deterministic performance. | 5 | The language is clear and concise, stating a distinct goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a deterministic performance target with predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A very strong intent that clearly defines a specific performance goal for deterministic services, although the scope is not fully specified. |
| 21 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with high-priority 5 x86_64 cores and 5GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 4 | The specification of compute resources (CPU architecture, cores, memory type) is fundamental to NFV infrastructure, which underpins 5G. These are not 3GPP terms but are essential for deployment. | 4 | The intent is specific, detailing the CPU architecture (x86_64), core count, memory size, and memory type (DDR5). | 5 | The instruction is clear, simple, and unambiguous. | 5 | The description's action to "Provision...resources" is a direct match for a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The sentence is coherent and logically structured. | 5 | The specified components (x86_64 cores, DDR5 memory) are consistent parts of a modern compute server configuration. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it does not specify which network function these resources are for, or on which host they should be provisioned. | 4.4 | A clear and specific request for resource provisioning, but it lacks the context of which network function to deploy on them. |
| 22 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant LSTM_Autoencoder anomaly detection with mission-critical 65% data sampling over 139days retention period. | 3 | The application of ML models like LSTM Autoencoders for anomaly detection aligns with NWDAF concepts (TS 23.288). However, the specific model and parameters (sampling, retention) are implementation details, not 3GPP standards. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying the ML model, a data sampling rate, and a long data retention period. | 4 | The intent is well-structured and technically precise, although it uses specialized ML terminology. | 5 | This is a request to "Compile...insights," which fits the Intent Report Request type, treating insights as a form of report. | 5 | The intent logically connects the method (LSTM on sampled historical data) to the desired output (analytics insights). | 5 | Using a fault-tolerant anomaly detection model on a large historical dataset with sampling is a consistent and valid data science approach. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify which data or KPIs should be analyzed for anomalies. | 4.3 | A complex and technically sophisticated request for an analytics report, but it's too abstract as it fails to mention what data to analyze. |
| 23 | Deployment Intent | Configure 5000ms performance averaging windows for 5QI_7_Voice_Video_Gaming QoS flow management, providing consistent service quality and fair resource distribution. | 5 | 5QI (5G QoS Identifier) is a core 3GPP concept from TS 23.501. 5QI 7 is standardized for Voice, Video (live streaming), and Gaming. The configuration of averaging windows is a valid implementation parameter for QoS management. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies a particular 5QI, a specific time window for performance averaging, and the high-level goals. | 5 | The intent is clear, technically precise, and easy to understand for a network engineer. | 5 | The action to "Configure" a specific QoS parameter is a clear Deployment Intent (or could be a Modification Intent, but Deployment is acceptable for initial setup). | 5 | The sentence is coherent, linking a specific configuration parameter to the service type it affects and the desired outcomes. | 5 | Configuring an averaging window for a specific 5QI is a consistent and logical way to manage QoS for that service type. | 4 | The intent is quite complete but could be improved by specifying which performance metric the averaging window applies to (e.g., latency, jitter). | 4.7 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent that specifies a detailed QoS management parameter for a standard 5G service type. |
| 24 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 8 x86_64 processing cores at 2.0GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | This intent correctly refers to a 3GPP NF (AMF) and relevant constraints (computational requirements, deterministic performance). The hardware specs (x86_64, cores, GHz) are standard for NFV infrastructure. | 4 | The intent is complex, asking for a feasibility assessment based on a combination of hardware specs, NF type, and performance constraints. | 5 | The sentence is clear, well-structured, and presents an unambiguous request. | 5 | The initial verb "Assess" and the term "feasibility" make this a perfect match for the Intent Feasibility Check type. | 5 | The request is coherent, logically asking to evaluate if given resources are sufficient for a specific NF under certain performance demands. | 5 | The parameters are consistent: assessing CPU resources against the performance needs of an AMF is a standard pre-deployment step. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary information for a feasibility check: the NF, the resources to check, and the criteria for success. | 4.9 | An excellent example of a feasibility check, providing clear, specific, and relevant parameters for the assessment. |
| 25 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with high-priority 78 ARM64 processing cores at 2.33GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly identifies the AMF and considers relevant constraints. The use of ARM64 architecture is increasingly common in telco infrastructure, making this a realistic and standards-adjacent check. | 4 | This request is complex, specifying the NF, CPU architecture, a high core count, clock speed, and the assessment criteria. | 5 | The language is clear and precise, forming a well-structured and easily understandable request. | 5 | The phrasing "Assess...feasibility" directly corresponds to the Intent Feasibility Check type. | 5 | The request is logically sound, asking to check if a specific, powerful hardware configuration can meet the demands of the AMF. | 5 | All elements are consistent; it is a standard practice to evaluate hardware feasibility before deploying a critical network function like the AMF. | 5 | The intent gives all the necessary inputs for the feasibility study: the function, the resources, and the constraints. | 4.9 | Another exemplary feasibility check, highlighting a realistic assessment for an ARM-based 5G deployment. |
| 26 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 94 processing cores and 229GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 3 | While specifying core and memory allocation is standard, the phrase "with transport network optimization" is extremely vague and not a 3GPP-defined procedure linked directly to compute resource modification. | 3 | The intent specifies the compute resources to be modified but the second part of the request is very high-level. | 3 | The intent is readable but the connection between modifying core/memory and "transport network optimization" is unclear and ambiguous. | 5 | The action "Modify...allocation" fits the Modification Intent type perfectly. | 2 | The intent lacks coherence. It's not clear how changing the compute allocation of a core network function directly relates to or triggers "transport network optimization." | 2 | The two actions seem disconnected and potentially inconsistent. Modifying compute resources is a localized action, while transport optimization is a network-wide one. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It doesn't state which NF's resources are being modified, nor does it define what "transport network optimization" means. | 2.9 | A poorly constructed intent that is vague, incoherent, and incomplete. The link between the two clauses is not explained. |
| 27 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 164GB DDR5 memory and 9224GB SATA_SSD storage with high-priority deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (DDR5, SATA SSD) are standard infrastructure components. "Deterministic performance impact analysis" is a valid and important consideration for 5G services like URLLC. | 4 | The intent specifies large amounts of memory and storage and asks for a complex impact analysis, making it a non-trivial check. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 5 | It is consistent to evaluate the performance impact of specific memory and storage technologies, especially for deterministic workloads. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.4 | A clear and well-defined feasibility check for infrastructure components, but it lacks the crucial context of the workload or NF it would support. |
| 28 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | 5G-AKA is the standard 5G authentication protocol. However, 256-NEA1 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (should be 128-bit). The concept of alerting on failures is valid. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a non-standard algorithm, and a key rotation notification. | 3 | The structure is slightly ambiguous, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event using "with". | 5 | The intent is a request to "Alert," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | Combining failure alerts and scheduled event notifications in one sentence hurts coherence as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Using a non-standard algorithm name is inconsistent with the standard 5G-AKA. The combination of different notification types is also functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks details on the notification channel or recipients. | 3.6 | A decent notification intent that correctly references 5G-AKA but is weakened by using a non-standard algorithm name and a slightly incoherent structure. |

The goal of securing performance without compromising it is valid. However, there is a typo "high-priorityout". | 4 | The intent is complex, linking specific, advanced security protocols to the assurance of deterministic performance. | 2 | The typo "high-priorityout compromising" breaks the sentence and makes it difficult to parse correctly. | 5 | The core goal is to assure performance under specific security conditions, which matches the intent type. | 3 | The typo disrupts the coherence and logical flow of the sentence. | 4 | The components are consistent (using standard security for a secure system), but the typo introduces ambiguity. | 3 | The intent is incomplete due to the typo which makes the meaning unclear. It also doesn't specify what infrastructure is being secured. | 3.6 | A conceptually strong intent that is severely flawed by a typo, which damages its readability, coherence, and completeness. |

| 35 | Performance Assurance Intent | Establish cognitive performance assurance using lstm_with_attention_mechanism neural networks with deep learning for intelligent network optimization. [Instance-2235-4994] | 3 | This aligns with the AI/ML-driven management vision of 3GPP (e.g., NWDAF). However, `lstm_with_attention_mechanism` is a very specific, non-standard ML model name. "Deep learning for intelligent network optimization" is also a very high-level concept. | 4 | The intent specifies a sophisticated neural network architecture and links it to cognitive assurance, indicating high complexity. | 3 | The intent is readable but very abstract and jargony. "Cognitive performance assurance" is a buzzword that lacks a concrete definition here. | 5 | The goal of establishing performance assurance, albeit with advanced methods, matches the intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent in that it links an advanced ML technique to an advanced assurance concept. | 4 | The elements are consistent with an AI-driven network management approach. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It provides no specific KPIs, targets, or network domains to apply this complex model to. | 3.6 | A visionary but overly abstract intent that names a complex ML model but provides no actionable parameters for its use. |
| 36 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization with genetic algorithms for complex performance trade-off management. [Instance-2236-5010] | 3 | The use of advanced optimization algorithms is conceptually aligned with 3GPP's vision for network automation, but this specific algorithm is not a 3GPP standard. The phrasing is also repetitive. | 4 | The intent specifies a sophisticated optimization technique for a complex problem (performance trade-offs), indicating high complexity. | 2 | The readability is poor due to the repetition of "multi_objective_genetic_algorithm multi-objective optimization with genetic algorithms". | 5 | The goal is to manage performance trade-offs, which is a key part of performance assurance. | 3 | The repetitive phrasing makes the intent less coherent than it could be. | 4 | The use of a genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization is a consistent and valid approach in engineering. | 2 | The intent is extremely incomplete, failing to specify which performance objectives are being traded off (e.g., latency vs. throughput). | 3.3 | This intent describes a valid, complex optimization approach but is poorly phrased and too abstract to be actionable. |

The phrase "high-priority_attention_mechanism" is awkwardly formatted. | 5 | This intent is extremely complex, specifying the new model, its target accuracy, and the optimization algorithm used for its training or tuning. | 2 | The readability is poor due to awkwardly formatted model names ("lstm_with high-priority_attention_mechanism") and redundant priority flags. | 5 | The action "Update artificial intelligence models" is a clear modification. | 3 | The phrasing is clumsy and hard to parse, which reduces coherence. | 4 | The components are conceptually consistent: updating an AI model to achieve a certain accuracy using an optimization algorithm is a standard ML workflow. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify which network function's model is being updated or what the model is predicting. | 3.6 | A complex but poorly written intent that describes an ML model update. It lacks clarity and crucial context. |
| 38 | Performance Assurance Intent | Achieve autonomous deterministic performance management with high-priority minimal human intervention and intelligent self-optimization. | 3 | This reflects the high-level goals of 3GPP's Zero Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) framework. However, it contains no specific technical details, only buzzwords. | 2 | The intent is very simple, stating a high-level, aspirational goal without any concrete parameters. | 4 | The language is clear and easy to read, although it is very high-level. | 5 | The goal is to achieve performance management, which aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The sentence is coherent and expresses a clear, albeit abstract, objective. | 5 | The concepts of autonomous management, minimal human intervention, and self-optimization are all consistent with each other. | 1 | This intent is completely lacking in actionable detail. It does not specify any KPIs, targets, or systems to be managed. | 3.6 | An aspirational "buzzword salad" intent. While it reflects the goals of modern network management, it is entirely non-actionable. |
| 39 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize deterministic performance achieving 389ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI, and "deterministic performance" is a key 5G concept. Predictive analytics and automated remediation are aligned with NWDAF and ZSM principles. | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (389ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it. | 5 | The language is clear and concise, stating a distinct goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a deterministic performance target with predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but would be more complete if it specified which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong, clear, and actionable intent that defines a specific performance goal and the high-level mechanisms to enforce it. |

| 41 | Performance Assurance Intent | Monitor network performance using One_Class_SVM behavioral anomaly detection with Random_Forest predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. [Instance-2241-5046] | 4 | This is conceptually aligned with 3GPP NWDAF (TS 23.288), which uses analytics for network performance. One-Class SVM and Random Forest are standard ML models appropriate for these tasks, though not 3GPP-specified terms. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying two distinct and appropriate ML models for different tasks (anomaly detection vs. prediction) to achieve a single goal. | 4 | The sentence is well-structured and clear, though dense with technical ML terminology. | 5 | The description's goal is to "Monitor network performance...enabling proactive performance management," which is the definition of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, logically connecting the tools (SVM, Random Forest) to the goal (proactive management). | 5 | Using an unsupervised model for anomaly detection and a supervised model for prediction is a consistent and common approach in data science. | 3 | The intent is conceptually complete but lacks specific KPIs or the network domain to which these models should be applied. | 4.4 | A strong, complex intent that clearly describes an ML-driven approach to performance assurance, but it needs more specific targets to be fully actionable. |
| 42 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 4hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-2242-5062] | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence, as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Combining reactive, failure-based alerting with proactive, time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.6 | A decent notification request using correct 3GPP security terminology, but its coherence and consistency are weakened by combining two different types of notifications. |
| 43 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2243-5078] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard 3GPP performance indicators. "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" is a plausible implementation detail for NFV infrastructure, related to resource management.

| 59 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 499GB LPDDR5 memory and 6803GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (LPDDR5, NVMe PCIe4) are high-performance infrastructure components. The request for a "performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies very large amounts of high-performance memory/storage and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using these specific high-speed components. | 5 | It is consistent and important to evaluate the performance impact of specialized hardware. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.4 | A good feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but it critically lacks the context of the intended application or network function. |
| 60 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 95 processing cores and 299GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | Specifying compute resources (cores, memory) and execution timeouts are standard parameters in virtualized environments (NFVI). This is a typical resource modification request. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies not just resource quantities but also a performance constraint (execution timeout). | 5 | The intent is very clear, precise, and includes the business/operational goals (optimizing performance, cost efficiency). | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a perfect fit for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the resource adjustment to a specific constraint and the overall optimization goals. | 5 | Modifying compute resources and setting an execution timeout are consistent actions for managing a virtualized workload. | 4 | The intent is very well-defined but is missing the name of the network function or application whose resources are being adjusted. | 4.6 | An excellent, clear, and well-justified intent for modifying compute resources, lacking only the target NF's identity. |
| 61 | Deployment Intent | Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 267Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 20.21ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics. | 5 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are fundamental 3GPP QoS parameters used to define QoS Flows (TS 23.501). This intent correctly uses these to define a service. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying a service with GBR, a strict PDB, and linking it to deterministic performance for critical applications. | 4 | The intent is clear, but the repetition of "mission-critical" and "critical priority" is slightly redundant. | 5 | The action to "Launch...network service" is a clear Deployment Intent. | 4 | The sentence is coherent but could be more concise without the repetitive priority markers. | 5 | The parameters (high GBR, strict PDB, deterministic performance) are all consistent with the definition of a mission-critical service. | 5 | The intent is complete enough to define the top-level QoS characteristics of a new service to be deployed. | 4.7 | A very strong and standards-aligned intent to deploy a new GBR service, with only minor redundancy in its wording. |
| 62 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 175GB DDR5 memory and 7391GB SATA_SSD storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (DDR5, SATA SSD) are standard infrastructure components. The request for a "performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies large amounts of memory and storage and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 4 | There is a slight inconsistency in pairing high-speed DDR5 memory with slower SATA SSD storage for a "high-priority" analysis, but it's a plausible configuration to evaluate. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.3 | A clear feasibility check request that is weakened by the lack of context for the workload and a slightly mismatched hardware combination. |
| 63 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 82 processing cores and 273GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 3 | While specifying core and memory allocation is standard, the phrase "with transport network optimization" is extremely vague and not a 3GPP-defined procedure linked directly to compute resource modification. | 3 | The intent specifies the compute resources to be modified but the second part of the request is very high-level. | 3 | The intent is readable but the connection between modifying core/memory and "transport network optimization" is unclear and ambiguous. | 5 | The action "Modify...allocation" fits the Modification Intent type perfectly. | 2 | The intent lacks coherence. It's not clear how changing the compute allocation of a core network function directly relates to or triggers "transport network optimization." | 2 | The two actions seem disconnected and potentially inconsistent. Modifying compute resources is a localized action, while transport optimization is a network-wide one. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It doesn't state which NF's resources are being modified, nor does it define what "transport network optimization" means. | 2.9 | A poorly constructed intent that is vague, incoherent, and incomplete. The link between the two clauses is not explained. |
| 64 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 48 processing cores and 148GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | Specifying compute resources (cores, memory) and execution timeouts are standard parameters in virtualized environments (NFVI). The goal of "deterministic performance" is aligned with 5G concepts. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies resource quantities, a performance constraint (execution timeout), and a performance goal (deterministic). | 5 | The intent is very clear, precise, and includes the business/operational goals (optimizing performance, cost efficiency). | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a perfect fit for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the resource adjustment to a specific constraint and the overall optimization goals. | 5 | Modifying compute resources and setting an execution timeout are consistent actions for managing a virtualized workload for deterministic performance. | 4 | The intent is very well-defined but is missing the name of the network function or application whose resources are being adjusted. | 4.6 | An excellent, clear, and well-justified intent for modifying compute resources, lacking only the target NF's identity. |
| 65 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 23 core utilization and 248GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent is well-aligned with 3GPP standards, correctly identifying the AMF, using standard metrics, and referencing "deterministic performance." | 5 | The intent is very specific, providing the NF, precise resource figures, the type of analysis, and the required output. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable, making it suitable for automation. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance analytics report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The intent is coherently structured, outlining the required action, its parameters, and the desired result in a logical flow. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of performance metrics to the goal of resource optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed intent that correctly combines a request for a report with the specific context of deterministic performance. |
| 66 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 515ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI. The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the closed-loop automation concepts in 3GPP management frameworks (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (515ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, stating a clear goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a target metric with enabling technologies like predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong, clear, and actionable intent that defines a specific performance goal and the high-level mechanisms to enforce it. |
| 67 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 33 processing cores and 108GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | Specifying compute resources and execution timeouts are standard parameters in NFV infrastructure environments. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies not just resource quantities but also a performance constraint (execution timeout). | 5 | The intent is very clear, precise, and includes the business/operational goals. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a perfect fit for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the resource adjustment to a specific constraint and the overall optimization goals. | 5 | Modifying compute resources and setting an execution timeout are consistent actions for managing a virtualized workload. | 4 | The intent is very well-defined but is missing the name of the network function or application whose resources are being adjusted. | 4.6 | An excellent, clear, and well-justified intent for modifying compute resources, lacking only the target NF's identity. |
| 68 | Modification Intent | Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 21Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance. | 4 | Traditional MIMO (4T4R) and Horizontal Beamforming are standard 3GPP RAN concepts. Backhaul capacity is a critical, related parameter. | 4 | The intent is complex, involving modifications to antenna configuration, beamforming, and a related transport network parameter. | 4 | The intent is clear and technically sound, though it combines a RAN modification with a transport network enhancement. | 5 | The action "Reconfigure" makes this a clear Modification Intent. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking RAN changes to backhaul enhancements with the goal of improving performance. | 4 | While RAN and backhaul are distinct domains, modifying them together for a common goal is a consistent and practical approach to network optimization. | 4 | The intent is specific but could be more complete by detailing what "optimization" and "enhancement" entail. | 4.1 | A good, practical intent that combines modifications across RAN and transport domains, but it could be more specific about the changes. |
| 69 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 270GB LPDDR5 memory and 1054GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (LPDDR5, NVMe PCIe4) are high-performance infrastructure components. The request for a "performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies large amounts of high-performance memory/storage and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 5 | It is consistent and important to evaluate the performance impact of specialized hardware. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.4 | A good feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but it critically lacks the context of the intended application or network function. |
| 70 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 17 core utilization and 198GB memory consumption patterns with high-priority detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Aligns perfectly with 3GPP management specifications (e.g., TS 28.552) by targeting the AMF with standard metrics. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, providing the NF, precise resource figures, and the expected output. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, making it ideal for automated processing. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The sentence is logically constructed, outlining the required action and its parameters clearly. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of resource metrics to the goal of optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed intent that serves as a perfect template for a resource performance report request. |
| 71 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 150ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI. The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the closed-loop automation concepts in 3GPP management frameworks (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (150ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, stating a clear goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a target metric with enabling technologies like predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong, clear, and actionable intent that defines a specific performance goal and the high-level mechanisms to enforce it. |
| 72 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 18hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | 5G-AKA is the standard 5G authentication protocol. However, 256-NEA1 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (should be 128-bit). The concept of alerting on failures is valid. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a non-standard algorithm, and a key rotation notification. | 3 | The structure is slightly ambiguous, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event using "with". | 5 | The intent is a request to "Alert," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | Combining failure alerts and scheduled event notifications in one sentence hurts coherence as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Using a non-standard algorithm name is inconsistent with the standard 5G-AKA. The combination of different notification types is also functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks details on the notification channel or recipients. | 3.6 | A decent notification intent that correctly references 5G-AKA but is weakened by using a non-standard algorithm name and a slightly incoherent structure. |
| 73 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 383893_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and 5G_AKA/128_NEA3 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 5 | This is an excellent feasibility check. It considers device density (a key parameter for mMTC slices), and correctly links standard security mechanisms (5G-AKA, 128-NEA3) to their performance overhead, which is a critical and realistic consideration. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, asking for an analysis of the combined impact of high device density and security protocol overhead on overall system performance. | 5 | The request is clear, technically precise, and addresses a complex, real-world engineering problem. | 5 | The action to "Consider...impact" is a form of feasibility assessment, fitting the intent type. | 5 | The intent is perfectly coherent, linking multiple factors (density, security) to their potential impact on system-level KPIs (performance, scalability). | 5 | The parameters are consistent; high device density and security overhead both strain system resources, and analyzing their combined effect is a crucial step. | 4 | The intent is very good but could be more complete by specifying which "system" (e.g., RAN, AMF, entire core) should be the focus of the analysis. | 4.9 | An outstanding, practical, and technically deep feasibility check that addresses a critical and complex 5G deployment challenge. |
| 74 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 84 x86_64 processing cores at 3.12GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly identifies the AMF and considers relevant constraints. The hardware specs are standard for NFV infrastructure. | 4 | This request is complex, specifying the NF, CPU architecture, a high core count, a high clock speed, and the assessment criteria. | 5 | The language is clear and precise, forming a well-structured and easily understandable request. | 5 | The phrasing "Assess...feasibility" directly corresponds to the Intent Feasibility Check type. | 5 | The request is logically sound, asking to check if a specific hardware configuration can meet the demands of the AMF. | 5 | All elements are consistent; it is a standard practice to evaluate hardware feasibility before deploying a critical network function. | 5 | The intent gives all the necessary inputs for the feasibility study: the function, the resources, and the constraints. | 4.9 | An excellent example of a feasibility check, providing clear, specific, and relevant parameters for the assessment. |
| 75 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 251GB HBM2 memory and 5864GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (HBM2, NVMe PCIe4) are high-performance infrastructure components. The request for a "performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies very large amounts of high-performance memory/storage and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 5 | It is consistent and important to evaluate the performance impact of specialized hardware. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.4 | A good feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but it critically lacks the context of the intended application or network function. |
| 76 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 92Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with high-priority 93.17ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 5 | Bitrate and latency are standard KPIs. Analyzing their feasibility against network topology and traffic patterns is a fundamental network planning task and a perfect example of a feasibility check. | 4 | The intent is complex, requiring an analysis that considers not just target KPIs but also the underlying network structure and traffic conditions. | 5 | The request is very clear, precise, and well-formulated. | 5 | The action "Analyze...feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, correctly identifying that delivering a specific QoS (bitrate/latency) is dependent on topology and traffic. | 4 | The target of 92Mbps bitrate and ~93ms latency is somewhat modest and the latency is not "ultra-low." However, checking their feasibility is still a consistent task. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying the endpoints or the service type this applies to. | 4.6 | A very strong and practical feasibility check that correctly frames a performance analysis problem, despite the "ultra-low" label being a slight exaggeration. |
| 77 | Performance Assurance Intent | Establish comprehensive BRONZE_TIER Service Level Agreement with mission-critical 99.99% availability guarantee and 99.9% reliability commitment, implementing research-grade sophisticated monitoring and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Availability and reliability are standard SLA parameters. While "BRONZE_TIER" is a non-standard local definition, it's a common practice. The concepts align with 3GPP management principles. | 4 | The intent is complex, defining a service tier with specific availability/reliability targets and mandating advanced monitoring and remediation. | 3 | The phrase "research-grade sophisticated monitoring" is vague, jargony, and adds little value, slightly hurting readability. | 5 | The goal is to "Establish...Service Level Agreement" with performance guarantees, which is a core part of performance assurance. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking an SLA tier to its specific metrics and the means to enforce them. | 4 | The availability (four nines) and reliability (three nines) targets are consistent, though the reliability seems low for a "mission-critical" SLA. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete for a high-level SLA definition but would need more KPIs for a full implementation. | 4.0 | A good intent for defining a service tier, using standard SLA metrics, but it employs some vague jargon and has a slight mismatch in its reliability target. |
| 78 | Modification Intent | Adjust network high-capacity to 5883Mbps broadband allocation and 480586_devices_per_km2 connection density requirements, accommodating growing user demands and traffic patterns. | 4 | Network capacity (throughput) and connection density are key performance parameters in 5G, especially for eMBB and mMTC service scenarios, respectively. | 4 | The intent is complex as it requires adjusting two different, potentially conflicting network parameters (high throughput per user vs. high density of users). | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and includes the business driver ("accommodating growing user demands"). | 5 | The action to "Adjust" network parameters is a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, stating the required changes and the reason for them. | 4 | Modifying both broadband capacity and connection density simultaneously is a consistent action during network evolution, but optimizing for both can be a trade-off. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but lacks the specific network slice or area where these new parameters should be applied. | 4.4 | A strong, clear, and relevant intent for network capacity evolution, but it lacks specific scope. |
| 79 | Modification Intent | Adjust network high-capacity to 3500Mbps broadband allocation and 278726_devices_per_km2 connection density requirements, accommodating growing user demands and traffic patterns. | 4 | Network capacity and connection density are key 5G performance parameters, relevant to eMBB and mMTC slice types. | 4 | The intent is complex as it requires adjusting two different network parameters that may have conflicting resource requirements. | 5 | The intent is clear, specific, and includes the business rationale. | 5 | The action to "Adjust" network parameters is a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, stating the required changes and the reason for them. | 4 | Modifying both broadband capacity and connection density simultaneously is a consistent action during network evolution, but optimizing for both can be a trade-off. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but lacks the specific network slice or area where these new parameters should be applied. | 4.4 | A strong, clear, and relevant intent for network capacity evolution, but it lacks specific scope. |
| 80 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using Certificate_Based authentication and 128_NEA3 encryption with 24hours automated key management. | 5 | Certificate-based authentication is a standard security practice, and 128-NEA3 (AES in CTR mode) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies the authentication method, encryption algorithm, and a specific policy for key management. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and easy to understand for both humans and automation systems. | 5 | The goal is to "secure performance assurance," which is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, listing the specific security mechanisms that will be used to achieve the assurance goal. | 5 | The components—certificate-based auth, strong encryption, and automated key management—are all consistent parts of a robust security posture. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could be more complete by stating where these security policies should be applied. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-compliant intent that effectively combines multiple security parameters into a single assurance goal. |
| 81 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 100 core utilization and 313GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent is well-aligned with 3GPP standards, correctly identifying the AMF, using standard metrics, and referencing "deterministic performance." | 5 | The intent is very specific, providing the NF, precise resource figures, the type of analysis, and the required output. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable, making it suitable for automation. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance analytics report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The intent is coherently structured, outlining the required action, its parameters, and the desired result in a logical flow. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of performance metrics to the goal of resource optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed intent that correctly combines a request for a report with the specific context of deterministic performance. |

Applying this to "multi-domain orchestration" is a plausible and important security consideration. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the cryptographic primitive, key size, and a specific automated rotation policy for a complex use case. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, technically precise, and includes the rationale for the action. | 5 | The action to "Secure" an orchestration system by deploying a security feature fits the Deployment Intent type. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the technical specifications to the security goals they achieve. | 5 | The components—a strong HMAC, a strong key size, and frequent rotation—are all consistent elements of a robust security design. | 4 | The intent is very clear but could be more complete by specifying which orchestration interfaces or systems this applies to. | 4.6 | An excellent and technically precise intent for deploying a security mechanism for a critical management function. |
| 83 | Deployment Intent | Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 17Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 1.87ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics. | 5 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are fundamental 3GPP QoS parameters (TS 23.501). A PDB of ~2ms is extremely aggressive and aligns with the most stringent URLLC requirements. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying a GBR service with an extremely strict PDB, explicitly linking it to deterministic performance for critical applications. | 4 | The intent is clear, but the repetition of "mission-critical" is slightly redundant. | 5 | The action to "Launch...network service" is a clear Deployment Intent. | 4 | The sentence is coherent but could be more concise without the repetitive priority markers. | 5 | The parameters (modest GBR, extremely low PDB, deterministic performance) are all consistent with a classic URLLC service profile. | 5 | The intent is complete enough to define the top-level QoS characteristics of a new URLLC service to be deployed. | 4.7 | A very strong and standards-aligned intent to deploy a new URLLC service, with only minor redundancy in its wording. |

Backhaul capacity is a critical, related parameter. | 4 | The intent is complex, involving modifications to antenna configuration, beamforming, and a related transport network parameter. | 4 | The intent is clear and technically sound. Pairing 3D beamforming with a traditional 4T4R setup is less common than with Massive MIMO but is technically feasible. | 5 | The action "Reconfigure" makes this a clear Modification Intent. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking RAN changes to backhaul enhancements with the goal of improving performance. | 4 | While RAN and backhaul are distinct domains, modifying them together for a common goal is a consistent and practical approach to network optimization. | 4 | The intent is specific but could be more complete by detailing what "optimization" and "enhancement" entail. | 4.1 | A good, practical intent that combines modifications across RAN and transport domains, but it could be more specific about the changes. |

Specifying a target prediction accuracy is a valid MLOps concept. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying a particular ML architecture, a precise target accuracy, and its application for autonomous optimization. | 2 | The readability is poor due to the awkwardly formatted model name "lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism" and repetitive "mission-critical" flags. | 5 | The goal is to implement performance optimization, which is a key part of performance assurance. | 3 | The clumsy formatting of the model name and redundant keywords hurt the coherence of the sentence. | 4 | The elements are conceptually consistent: using a highly accurate predictive model for autonomous optimization is a valid AI-driven approach. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify what is being predicted or which KPIs are being optimized. | 3.6 | A complex but poorly written intent. The core idea is sound, but the non-standard and clumsy phrasing, along with a lack of context, makes it weak. |
| 86 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 59 processing cores and 303GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | Specifying compute resources and execution timeouts are standard parameters in NFV infrastructure environments. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies not just resource quantities but also a performance constraint (execution timeout). | 5 | The intent is very clear, precise, and includes the business/operational goals. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a perfect fit for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the resource adjustment to a specific constraint and the overall optimization goals. | 5 | Modifying compute resources and setting an execution timeout are consistent actions for managing a virtualized workload. | 4 | The intent is very well-defined but is missing the name of the network function or application whose resources are being adjusted. | 4.6 | An excellent, clear, and well-justified intent for modifying compute resources, lacking only the target NF's identity. |
| 87 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 143GB HBM2 memory and 2222GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (HBM2, SATA SSD) are standard infrastructure components. The request for a "performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies high-performance memory paired with standard storage and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 4 | There is a significant performance mismatch between HBM2 memory and a SATA SSD, making this an unusual but potentially valid configuration to evaluate for specific workloads (e.g., fast processing, bulk storage). | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.3 | A clear feasibility check request that is weakened by the lack of workload context and an unusual hardware combination that needs justification. |
| 88 | Deployment Intent | Secure multi-domain orchestration using HMAC_SHA256 key derivation functions with 256_bit cryptographic keys automatically rotated every 9hours, maintaining security posture across deployment lifecycle. | 4 | HMAC-SHA256 is a standard cryptographic function, and key rotation is a standard security practice. Applying this to "multi-domain orchestration" is a plausible and important security consideration. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the cryptographic primitive, key size, and a specific automated rotation policy for a complex use case. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, technically precise, and includes the rationale for the action. | 5 | The action to "Secure" an orchestration system by deploying a security feature fits the Deployment Intent type. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the technical specifications to the security goals they achieve. | 5 | The components—a strong HMAC, a strong key size, and frequent rotation—are all consistent elements of a robust security design. | 4 | The intent is very clear but could be more complete by specifying which orchestration interfaces or systems this applies to. | 4.6 | An excellent and technically precise intent for deploying a security mechanism for a critical management function. |

[Instance-2289-5282] | 5 | Throughput and latency are standard 3GPP KPIs. Analyzing the trade-offs between them, especially for deterministic performance, is a critical task in network management and aligns with performance reporting. | 5 | This is a highly complex request for an analysis report that requires comparing two conflicting KPIs, identifying bottlenecks, and providing optimization suggestions. | 5 | The intent is very clear, well-structured, and precisely defines the scope of the analysis. | 5 | The request to "Analyze...providing insights" is a perfect fit for an Intent Report Request. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, laying out a logical analysis workflow from comparison to bottleneck identification to optimization. | 5 | It's consistent and crucial to analyze the trade-off between high throughput and low latency, as they often compete for network resources. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the KPIs, their targets, and the type of insights required in the report. | 5.0 | An outstanding intent for a report.

Analyzing the feasibility of URLLC on NSA is a valid and important question, as NSA has limitations (e.g., reliance on LTE core). | 4 | The intent is complex, asking for an analysis of a specific slice type on a specific architecture, considering complex factors like deployment complexity and integration. | 3 | The readability is slightly impaired by the repetitive "ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency" and the somewhat clunky phrasing at the end. | 5 | The action "Analyze...implementation...complexity and requirements" is a clear feasibility check. | 4 | The intent is coherent, though the wording could be more streamlined. It correctly links the slice, architecture, and analysis criteria. | 5 | It is highly consistent to question the feasibility of demanding URLLC services on an NSA deployment, which is known to be a technical challenge. | 4 | The intent is well-scoped but could be more complete by specifying which integration points or complexity aspects to focus on. | 4.1 | A strong and technically relevant feasibility check, though its readability suffers from some repetitive and awkward phrasing. |
| 91 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 20hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-2291-5299] | 5 | Certificate-based authentication is standard practice, and 128-NEA3 (AES in CTR mode) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence, as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Combining reactive, failure-based alerting with proactive, time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.7 | A valid notification request that uses correct security terms but is hampered by a slightly incoherent and inconsistent structure. |
| 92 | Performance Assurance Intent | Ensure 1000Mbps high-throughput delivery and 5ms latency targets through intelligent traffic engineering and resource optimization. [Instance-2292-5315] | 5 | Throughput and latency are standard 3GPP KPIs.

[Instance-2293-5331] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard 3GPP performance indicators. "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" is a plausible implementation detail for NFV infrastructure. The repetition of "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying exact performance targets for both throughput and latency, and naming a specific scaling mechanism. | 3 | The readability is slightly reduced by the redundant phrase "high-throughput high-capacity". | 5 | The goal is to achieve specific performance targets (throughput, latency), which is a clear Performance Assurance Intent. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking the performance goals to the mechanism intended to achieve them. | 4 | There can be a trade-off between high throughput and ultra-low latency, making them potentially inconsistent goals if not carefully managed. Naming a scaling mechanism helps, but the challenge remains. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete but could benefit from specifying the context (e.g., for a specific slice or service). | 4.0 | A strong performance intent with specific, ambitious targets, though the phrasing is slightly redundant and the goals could be conflicting. |

| 98 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 400ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI. The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the closed-loop automation concepts in 3GPP management frameworks (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (400ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, stating a clear goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a target metric with enabling technologies like predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong, clear, and actionable intent that defines a specific performance goal and the high-level mechanisms to enforce it. |

The request for a "performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies memory/storage types and sizes and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 5 | It is consistent to evaluate the performance impact of specific hardware. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.4 | A good feasibility check for hardware components, but it critically lacks the context of the intended application or network function. |

However, it could be for a very small-scale or test deployment. | 5 | This intent is fully complete and actionable by an orchestration system. | 4.9 | A near-perfect example of a deployment intent, with the only question being the potential mismatch between the "high-performance" descriptor and the low resource allocation. |
| 101 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with high-priority 20hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol. However, 256-NEA2 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (should be 128-bit). 3GPP defines 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a non-standard algorithm, and a key rotation notification. | 3 | The structure is slightly ambiguous, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event using "with". | 5 | The intent is a request to "Alert," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | Combining failure alerts and scheduled event notifications in one sentence hurts coherence as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Using a non-standard algorithm name is inconsistent. The combination of different notification types is also functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks details on the notification channel or recipients. | 3.6 | A decent notification intent that correctly references EAP-TLS but is weakened by using a non-standard algorithm name and a slightly incoherent structure. |

| 103 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Particle_Swarm intelligent insights with mission-critical 182days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | Particle Swarm Optimization is a metaheuristic algorithm, not a 3GPP concept. Applying it for "intelligent insights" is plausible in the context of NWDAF, but the phrasing is abstract. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a non-trivial analysis method, a very long data retention period (182 days), and the type of notification (trend-based). | 3 | The phrase "using...Particle_Swarm intelligent insights" is somewhat vague and jargony, reducing readability. | 5 | The description is fundamentally a request to "Alert...for trend-based notifications," which clearly aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking the method of analysis (Particle Swarm on historical data) to the type of output (trend-based alerts). | 4 | The use of an optimization algorithm for generating "insights" for trend analysis is a consistent, if abstract, concept. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify what trends or KPIs should be monitored. | 3.7 | A conceptually interesting but abstract intent that lacks the specific metrics needed to be actionable. |
| 104 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using fault-tolerant EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with mission-critical 4hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a standard authentication method. However, 256-NEA1 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (3GPP specifies 128-bit NAS encryption). | 4 | The intent specifies the authentication method, a non-standard encryption algorithm, and a specific policy for key management. | 4 | The intent is clear and easy to understand, despite the non-standard term. | 5 | The goal is to "secure performance assurance," which is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, listing the specific security mechanisms that will be used to achieve the assurance goal. | 4 | The use of a non-standard encryption algorithm name is an inconsistency. Otherwise, the components are consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could be more complete by stating where these security policies should be applied. | 4.3 | A strong and clear intent that is only slightly flawed by the use of a non-standard name for the encryption algorithm. |
| 105 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant One_Class_SVM anomaly detection with mission-critical 92% data sampling over 34days retention period. | 3 | The application of ML models like One-Class SVM for anomaly detection is consistent with NWDAF principles (TS 23.288), but the model and parameters are not 3GPP standards. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying the ML model, a high data sampling rate, and a data retention period. | 4 | The intent is well-structured and technically precise, using specialized ML terminology. | 5 | This is a request to "Compile...insights," which fits the Intent Report Request type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the method (SVM on sampled historical data) to the desired output (analytics insights). | 5 | Using an anomaly detection model on a large historical dataset with sampling is a consistent and valid data science approach. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify which data, KPIs, or network segment should be analyzed for anomalies. | 4.3 | A complex and technically specific request for an analytics report, but it remains too abstract as it fails to define the data to be analyzed. |

The parameters are standard for NFV infrastructure. | 3 | The intent is moderately complex, specifying the compute resources and the target workload type. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded and easy to understand. | 5 | The action "Provision...resources" is a direct match for a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, stating what resources to provision and what they are for. | 5 | The specified resources are consistent with a small edge deployment. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify the location of the edge site or the type of processing cores (e.g., x86, ARM). | 4.3 | A clear, high-level intent for provisioning edge resources, but it lacks specific details needed for automated execution. |
| 118 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate PCF deployment through nfvo_d3710218274b Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_4b7fac97f7ba VNF Manager integration. | 5 | This intent correctly references the PCF (a 3GPP 5G core NF), and the NFVO and VNFM, which are key components of the ETSI NFV MANO framework. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies the NF to be deployed (PCF) and the specific management and orchestration entities by their identifiers. | 5 | The sentence is very clear, well-structured, and directly consumable by an orchestration system. | 5 | This is a classic deployment intent, instructing the orchestration of a network function through a specific management framework. | 5 | The instruction is perfectly coherent, describing a standard workflow for deploying a virtualized network function. | 5 | The roles of PCF, NFVO, and VNFM are described in a way that is perfectly consistent with ETSI NFV architecture. | 4 | The intent is actionable but could be more complete by including configuration details for the PCF itself. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-aligned intent describing a typical VNF deployment process through an NFV orchestrator. |
| 119 | Modification Intent | Adjust Massive_MIMO_64T64R radio parameters and Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming configuration with mission-critical core network coordination. | 4 | Massive MIMO (64T64R) and Horizontal Beamforming are valid 3GPP RAN concepts. The need for coordination with the core network is also a valid concept. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies modifications to both antenna (MIMO) and beamforming parameters and requires coordination with another network domain (core). | 4 | The intent is reasonably clear, although "core network coordination" is a high-level requirement that would need further specification. | 5 | The description's focus on "Adjust...parameters" makes it a clear fit for the Modification Intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking the adjustment of radio parameters to the need for broader network coordination. | 5 | Adjusting RAN parameters like MIMO and beamforming is a consistent set of actions. The need for core network coordination is also plausible. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it does not specify which radio parameters to adjust or what the "core network coordination" entails. | 4.1 | A good intent that correctly identifies relevant RAN technologies for modification, but it lacks the specific details needed to be fully actionable. |
| 120 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 17hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | 5G-AKA is the standard 5G authentication protocol. However, 256-NEA2 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (3GPP defines 128-NEA2, SNOW 3G). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a non-standard algorithm, and a key rotation notification. | 3 | The structure is slightly ambiguous, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event using "with". | 5 | The intent is a request to "Alert," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | Combining failure alerts and scheduled event notifications in one sentence hurts coherence as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Using a non-standard algorithm name is inconsistent. The combination of different notification types is also functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks details on the notification channel or recipients. | 3.6 | A decent notification intent that correctly references 5G-AKA but is weakened by using a non-standard algorithm name and a slightly incoherent structure. |
| 121 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 118 processing cores and 111GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | Specifying compute resources and execution timeouts are standard parameters in NFV infrastructure environments. The goal of "deterministic performance" is aligned with 5G concepts. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies resource quantities, a performance constraint (execution timeout), and a performance goal (deterministic). | 5 | The intent is very clear, precise, and includes the business/operational goals. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a perfect fit for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the resource adjustment to a specific constraint and the overall optimization goals. | 5 | Modifying compute resources and setting an execution timeout are consistent actions for managing a virtualized workload for deterministic performance. | 4 | The intent is very well-defined but is missing the name of the network function or application whose resources are being adjusted. | 4.6 | An excellent, clear, and well-justified intent for modifying compute resources, lacking only the target NF's identity. |
| 122 | Performance Assurance Intent | Achieve autonomous performance management with high-priority minimal human intervention and intelligent self-optimization. [Instance-2322-5523] | 3 | This reflects the high-level goals of 3GPP's Zero Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) framework. However, it contains no specific technical details, only high-level concepts. | 2 | The intent is very simple, stating a high-level, aspirational goal without any concrete parameters. | 4 | The language is clear and easy to read, although it is very high-level and uses buzzwords. | 5 | The goal is to achieve "performance management," which aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The sentence is coherent and expresses a clear, albeit abstract, objective. | 5 | The concepts of autonomous management, minimal human intervention, and self-optimization are all consistent with each other. | 1 | This intent is completely lacking in actionable detail. It does not specify any KPIs, targets, or systems to be managed. | 3.6 | An aspirational goal translated into an intent. While it reflects the vision of modern networks, it is entirely non-actionable as written. |
| 123 | Performance Assurance Intent | Establish cognitive performance assurance using lstm_with_attention_mechanism neural networks with deep learning for intelligent network optimization. [Instance-2323-5539] | 3 | This aligns with the AI/ML-driven management vision of 3GPP (e.g., NWDAF). However, `lstm_with_attention_mechanism` is a very specific, non-standard ML model name. "Deep learning for intelligent network optimization" is also a very high-level concept. | 4 | The intent specifies a sophisticated neural network architecture and links it to cognitive assurance, indicating high complexity. | 3 | The intent is readable but very abstract and jargony. "Cognitive performance assurance" is a buzzword that lacks a concrete definition here. | 5 | The goal of establishing performance assurance, albeit with advanced methods, matches the intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent in that it links an advanced ML technique to an advanced assurance concept. | 4 | The elements are consistent with an AI-driven network management approach. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It provides no specific KPIs, targets, or network domains to apply this complex model to. | 3.6 | A visionary but overly abstract intent that names a complex ML model but provides no actionable parameters for its use. |
| 124 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 84GB DDR5 memory and 6103GB SATA_SSD storage with high-priority deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (DDR5, SATA SSD) are standard infrastructure components. The request for a "deterministic performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies modern memory paired with standard, slower storage and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 4 | There is a performance mismatch between DDR5 memory and a SATA SSD, but it's a plausible configuration to evaluate, especially for cost-sensitive deterministic workloads. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.3 | A clear feasibility check request that is weakened by the lack of workload context. |
| 125 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 465GB HBM2 memory and 603GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (HBM2, NVMe PCIe4) are high-performance infrastructure components. The request for a "deterministic performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies very large amounts of high-performance memory/storage and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 5 | It is consistent and important to evaluate the performance impact of specialized hardware for deterministic workloads. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.4 | A good feasibility check for high-performance hardware, but it critically lacks the context of the intended application or network function. |
| 126 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Particle_Swarm intelligent insights with mission-critical 156days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 3 | Particle Swarm Optimization is a metaheuristic algorithm, not a 3GPP concept. Applying it for "intelligent insights" is plausible in the context of NWDAF, but the phrasing is abstract. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a non-trivial analysis method, a very long data retention period (156 days), and the type of notification (trend-based). | 3 | The phrase "using...Particle_Swarm intelligent insights" is somewhat vague and jargony, reducing readability. | 5 | The description is fundamentally a request to "Alert...for trend-based notifications," which clearly aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking the method of analysis (Particle Swarm on historical data) to the type of output (trend-based alerts). | 4 | The use of an optimization algorithm for generating "insights" for trend analysis is a consistent, if abstract, concept. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify what trends or KPIs should be monitored. | 3.7 | A conceptually interesting but abstract intent that lacks the specific metrics needed to be actionable. |
| 127 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 518ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI. The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the closed-loop automation concepts in 3GPP management frameworks (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (518ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, stating a clear goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a target metric with enabling technologies like predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong, clear, and actionable intent that defines a specific performance goal and the high-level mechanisms to enforce it. |
| 128 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 16hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a standard authentication method. However, 256-NEA1 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (3GPP specifies 128-bit NAS encryption). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a non-standard algorithm, and a key rotation notification. | 3 | The structure is slightly ambiguous, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event using "with". | 5 | The intent is a request to "Alert," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | Combining failure alerts and scheduled event notifications in one sentence hurts coherence as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Using a non-standard algorithm name is inconsistent.

| 130 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 25 core utilization and 196GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Aligns perfectly with 3GPP management specifications (e.g., TS 28.552) by targeting the AMF with standard metrics. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, providing the NF, precise resource figures, and the expected output. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, making it ideal for automated processing. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The sentence is logically constructed, outlining the required action and its parameters clearly. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of resource metrics to the goal of optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed intent that serves as a perfect template for a resource performance report request. |
| 131 | Deployment Intent | Launch medium priority network service guaranteeing 134Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 24.19ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics. | 5 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are fundamental 3GPP QoS parameters used to define QoS Flows (TS 23.501). This intent correctly uses these to define a service. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying a service with GBR, a strict PDB, and linking it to deterministic performance for critical applications. | 4 | The intent is clear but there's a slight contradiction between "medium priority" and "supporting mission-critical applications." | 5 | The action to "Launch...network service" is a clear Deployment Intent. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, defining the service's QoS characteristics and its intended use. | 3 | There is an inconsistency between labeling the service "medium priority" while also stating it supports "mission-critical applications" with "deterministic performance." Mission-critical services are typically high priority. | 5 | The intent is complete enough to define the top-level QoS characteristics of a new service to be deployed. | 4.6 | A very strong and standards-aligned intent to deploy a new GBR service, marred only by an inconsistency in its priority labeling. |
| 132 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 3minutes/13minutes/58minutes multi-tier escalation through SNMP notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | Multi-tier escalation and SNMP are standard network management concepts. "Intelligent routing" of notifications is a plausible advanced feature, aligned with ZSM principles. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a three-tier escalation timeline, the notification protocol (SNMP), and an advanced routing requirement. | 4 | The intent is clear, though "intelligent routing" is a bit vague without further definition. | 5 | The description's purpose is to implement an escalation and notification policy, which fits the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, describing a complete notification workflow from timing to channel to routing. | 5 | The components—a timed escalation policy using a standard protocol—are perfectly consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It critically fails to specify what event or condition triggers this escalation policy. | 4.3 | A well-structured intent for a notification policy that is critically incomplete because it's missing the trigger condition. |

| 134 | Performance Assurance Intent | Monitor network performance using One_Class_SVM behavioral anomaly detection with Prophet predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. [Instance-2334-5591] | 4 | The use of specific ML models (One-Class SVM, Prophet) for network monitoring is conceptually aligned with 3GPP NWDAF. These models are well-suited for anomaly detection and time-series forecasting, respectively. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying two different, appropriate ML models for distinct tasks (anomaly detection and prediction) within the performance management lifecycle. | 4 | The sentence is well-structured and clear, though dense with technical ML terminology. | 5 | The description's goal is to "Monitor network performance...enabling proactive performance management," which perfectly defines performance assurance. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, logically connecting the tools (SVM, Prophet) to the goal (proactive management). | 5 | Using an unsupervised model for anomalies and a time-series model for prediction is a consistent and powerful combination for network analytics. | 3 | While conceptually complete, the intent lacks specific KPIs or the network domain to which these models should be applied, making it a high-level goal. | 4.4 | A strong, complex intent that clearly describes a sophisticated, ML-driven approach to performance assurance, needing only specific targets to be perfect. |
| 135 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous performance optimization using lstm_with_attention_mechanism machine learning models with 91.82% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 3 | This is conceptually aligned with NWDAF and ZSM, but the model name is a non-standard string. Specifying a target prediction accuracy is a valid MLOps concept. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying a particular ML architecture, a precise target accuracy, and its application for autonomous optimization. | 3 | The intent is readable, but the model name is non-standard jargon. | 5 | The goal is to implement performance optimization, which is a key part of performance assurance. | 4 | The sentence is coherent, linking the model to a performance target (accuracy) and its ultimate goal (optimization). | 4 | The elements are conceptually consistent: using a highly accurate predictive model for autonomous optimization is a valid AI-driven approach. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify what is being predicted or which KPIs are being optimized. | 3.9 | A complex intent describing a sound AI/ML approach, but it uses non-standard jargon and lacks the necessary context to be actionable. |
| 136 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 498ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Response time is a standard KPI. The use of predictive analytics and automated remediation aligns with the closed-loop automation concepts in 3GPP management frameworks (e.g., NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI (498ms response time) and the high-level methods to achieve it. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, stating a clear goal and the means to achieve it. | 5 | The description directly focuses on optimizing performance, which is the core of a Performance Assurance Intent. | 5 | The intent is coherent, linking a specific performance target with the advanced capabilities required to maintain it. | 5 | The combination of a target metric with enabling technologies like predictive analytics and automated remediation is internally consistent. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying which service or application the response time applies to. | 4.6 | A strong, clear, and actionable intent that defines a specific performance goal and the high-level mechanisms to enforce it. |
| 137 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | 5G-AKA is the standard 5G authentication protocol.

| 140 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 23hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is standard practice, and 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence, as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Combining reactive, failure-based alerting with proactive, time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.6 | A valid notification request that uses correct security terms but is hampered by a slightly incoherent and inconsistent structure. |
| 141 | Modification Intent | Update artificial intelligence models to lstm_with high-priority_attention_mechanism achieving 92.28% prediction accuracy with high-priority multi_objective_genetic_algorithm optimization algorithms, enhancing intelligent network operations. | 3 | This describes a modification to an AI/ML system, which is relevant to NWDAF. However, the model names and algorithms are non-standard implementation details. The phrase "high-priority_attention_mechanism" is awkwardly formatted. | 5 | This intent is extremely complex, specifying the new model, its target accuracy, and the optimization algorithm used for its training or tuning. | 2 | The readability is poor due to awkwardly formatted model names ("lstm_with high-priority_attention_mechanism") and redundant priority flags. | 5 | The action "Update artificial intelligence models" is a clear modification. | 3 | The phrasing is clumsy and hard to parse, which reduces coherence. | 4 | The components are conceptually consistent: updating an AI model to achieve a certain accuracy using an optimization algorithm is a standard ML workflow. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify which network function's model is being updated or what the model is predicting. | 3.6 | A complex but poorly written intent that describes an ML model update.

The focus on "deterministic" performance is key. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying distinct ML models for different tasks (anomaly detection vs. prediction) and linking them to a high-level goal for deterministic networks. | 4 | The sentence is well-structured and grammatically correct, though it is dense with technical jargon. The repetition of "deterministic" is a minor flaw. | 5 | The description directly addresses the goal of performance assurance through monitoring and proactive management. | 5 | The components of the intent are logically connected, starting from the method (ML models) to the outcome (proactive management). | 5 | Using fault-tolerant anomaly detection with predictive analytics is a consistent and standard approach for proactive network assurance. | 3 | The intent is conceptually complete but lacks specific KPIs or network segments to monitor, making it a high-level goal rather than a precise instruction. | 4.4 | A strong, complex intent that clearly articulates a modern, ML-driven approach to performance assurance for deterministic services, though it lacks specific metrics. |

"Intelligent routing" of notifications is a plausible advanced feature, aligned with ZSM principles. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying a three-tier escalation timeline, the notification protocol (gRPC), and an advanced routing requirement. | 4 | The intent is clear, though "intelligent routing" is a bit vague without further definition. | 5 | The description's purpose is to implement an escalation and notification policy, which fits the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, describing a complete notification workflow from timing to channel to routing. | 5 | The components—a timed escalation policy using a modern protocol—are perfectly consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It critically fails to specify what event or condition triggers this escalation policy. | 4.3 | A well-structured intent for a notification policy that is critically incomplete because it's missing the trigger condition. |
| 147 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant Isolation_Forest anomaly detection with mission-critical 74% data sampling over 275days retention period. | 3 | The application of ML models like Isolation Forest for anomaly detection is consistent with NWDAF principles (TS 23.288), but the model and parameters are not 3GPP standards. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying the ML model, a precise data sampling rate, and a very long data retention period. | 4 | The intent is well-structured and technically precise, using specialized ML terminology. | 5 | This is a request to "Compile...insights," which fits the Intent Report Request type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the method (Isolation Forest on sampled historical data) to the desired output (analytics insights). | 5 | Using an anomaly detection model on a large historical dataset with sampling is a consistent and valid data science approach. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify which data, KPIs, or network segment should be analyzed for anomalies. | 4.3 | A complex and technically specific request for an analytics report, but it remains too abstract as it fails to define the data to be analyzed. |
| 148 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 932Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with mission-critical 73.77ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 5 | Bitrate and latency are standard KPIs. Analyzing their feasibility against network topology and traffic patterns is a fundamental network planning task and a perfect example of a feasibility check. | 4 | The intent is complex, requiring an analysis that considers not just target KPIs but also the underlying network structure and traffic conditions. | 5 | The request is very clear, precise, and well-formulated. | 5 | The action "Analyze...feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is highly coherent, correctly identifying that delivering a specific QoS (bitrate/latency) is dependent on topology and traffic. | 4 | The target latency of ~74ms is not "ultra-low" in the context of URLLC, but it's a valid latency target for other services. Checking its feasibility is a consistent task. | 4 | The intent is well-defined but could be more complete by specifying the endpoints or the service type this applies to. | 4.6 | A very strong and practical feasibility check that correctly frames a performance analysis problem, despite the "ultra-low" label being a slight exaggeration. |
| 149 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 10hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is standard practice. However, 256-NEA1 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (should be 128-bit). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a non-standard algorithm, and a key rotation notification. | 3 | The structure is slightly ambiguous, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event using "with". | 5 | The intent is a request to "Alert," which perfectly matches the intent type. | 3 | Combining failure alerts and scheduled event notifications in one sentence hurts coherence as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Using a non-standard algorithm name is inconsistent. The combination of different notification types is also functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks details on the notification channel or recipients. | 3.6 | A decent notification intent that is weakened by using a non-standard algorithm name and a slightly incoherent structure. |
| 150 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 22hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence, as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Combining reactive, failure-based alerting with proactive, time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.6 | A valid notification request that uses correct security terms but is hampered by a slightly incoherent and inconsistent structure. |
| 151 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 2hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is standard practice, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm per 3GPP TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence, as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Combining reactive, failure-based alerting with proactive, time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.6 | A valid notification request that uses correct security terms but is hampered by a slightly incoherent and inconsistent structure. |

However, the model names and algorithms are non-standard implementation details. The phrase "lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism" is awkwardly formatted. | 5 | This intent is extremely complex, specifying the new model, its target accuracy, and the optimization algorithm used for its training or tuning. | 2 | The readability is poor due to awkwardly formatted model names and redundant priority flags. | 5 | The action "Update artificial intelligence models" is a clear modification. | 3 | The phrasing is clumsy and hard to parse, which reduces coherence. | 4 | The components are conceptually consistent: updating an AI model to achieve a certain accuracy using an optimization algorithm is a standard ML workflow. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify which network function's model is being updated or what the model is predicting. | 3.6 | A complex but poorly written intent that describes an ML model update. It lacks clarity and crucial context. |
| 153 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 8 core utilization and 290GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Aligns perfectly with 3GPP management specifications (e.g., TS 28.552) by targeting the AMF with standard metrics. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, providing the NF, precise resource figures, and the expected output. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous, making it ideal for automated processing. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The sentence is logically constructed, outlining the required action and its parameters clearly. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of resource metrics to the goal of optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed intent that serves as a perfect template for a resource performance report request. |

"Cognitive...assurance" is a buzzword. | 5 | The goal of establishing performance assurance, albeit with advanced methods, matches the intent type. | 3 | The intent is coherent in linking an ML technique to an assurance concept, but the poor phrasing and buzzwords reduce clarity. | 4 | The elements are consistent with an AI-driven network management approach. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It provides no specific KPIs, targets, or network domains to apply this complex model to. | 3.3 | A visionary but overly abstract and poorly phrased intent that names a complex ML model but provides no actionable parameters for its use. |
| 159 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 7 processing cores and 493GB memory allocation with high-priority 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | Specifying compute resources and execution timeouts are standard parameters in NFV infrastructure environments. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies not just resource quantities but also a performance constraint (execution timeout). | 5 | The intent is very clear, precise, and includes the business/operational goals. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a perfect fit for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is highly coherent, linking the resource adjustment to a specific constraint and the overall optimization goals. | 5 | Modifying compute resources and setting an execution timeout are consistent actions for managing a virtualized workload. | 4 | The intent is very well-defined but is missing the name of the network function or application whose resources are being adjusted. | 4.6 | An excellent, clear, and well-justified intent for modifying compute resources, lacking only the target NF's identity. |

However, the specific model and parameters are implementation details, not 3GPP standards. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying the ML model, a data sampling rate, and a long data retention period. | 4 | The intent is well-structured and technically precise, although it uses specialized ML terminology. | 5 | This is a request to "Compile...insights," which fits the Intent Report Request type, treating insights as a form of report. | 5 | The intent logically connects the method (LSTM on sampled historical data) to the desired output (analytics insights). | 5 | Using a fault-tolerant anomaly detection model on a large historical dataset with sampling is a consistent and valid data science approach. | 3 | The intent is incomplete. It doesn't specify which data or KPIs should be analyzed for anomalies. | 4.3 | A complex and technically sophisticated request for an analytics report, but it's too abstract as it fails to mention what data to analyze. |
| 162 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with 18hours automated key management. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method in 5G, and 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G) is a standardized 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies the authentication method, encryption algorithm, and a specific policy for key management. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and easy to understand for both humans and automation systems. | 5 | The goal is to "secure performance assurance," which is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, listing the specific security mechanisms that will be used to achieve the assurance goal. | 5 | The components—strong authentication, strong encryption, and automated key management—are all consistent parts of a robust security posture. | 4 | The intent is well-specified but could be more complete by stating where these security policies should be applied. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-compliant intent that effectively combines multiple security parameters into a single assurance goal. |
| 163 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 20hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence, as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Combining reactive, failure-based alerting with proactive, time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.6 | A valid notification request that uses correct security terms but is hampered by a slightly incoherent and inconsistent structure. |
| 164 | Modification Intent | Reconfigure Beamforming_8T8R antenna systems with Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 27Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance. | 3 | The antenna configuration `Beamforming_8T8R` is not a standard term; it's likely a mix of `Beamforming` and `MIMO_8T8R`. The other concepts are valid. | 4 | The intent is complex, involving modifications to antenna configuration, beamforming, and a related transport network parameter. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the non-standard antenna terminology is confusing. | 5 | The action "Reconfigure" makes this a clear Modification Intent. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking RAN changes to backhaul enhancements with the goal of improving performance. | 4 | While RAN and backhaul are distinct domains, modifying them together for a common goal is a consistent and practical approach to network optimization. | 4 | The intent is specific but could be more complete by detailing what "optimization" and "enhancement" entail. | 4.0 | A good, practical intent that is marred by non-standard terminology for the antenna system. |

| 166 | Modification Intent | Update QoS flow 5QI_70_Mission_Critical_Data configuration with 9641Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality. | 4 | 5QI (5G QoS Identifier) is a core 3GPP concept. However, 5QI 70 is not a standardized value (standardized values are typically 1-9, plus some higher numbers for specific services). This would be a custom, operator-defined 5QI, which is permissible. | 4 | The intent is complex, modifying a specific QoS flow with a very high maximum bitrate. | 4 | The intent is clear, although the 5QI value is non-standard. The term "maximum bitrate optimization" is slightly ambiguous - it could mean setting the MBR or optimizing the network to achieve it. | 5 | The action "Update QoS flow...configuration" is a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, stating the target, the change, and the desired outcome. | 5 | Modifying the bitrate for a specific QoS flow is a consistent and standard management action. | 4 | The intent is quite complete but could be clearer on whether it's setting the MBR parameter or performing a broader optimization. | 4.4 | A strong intent for QoS modification that uses 3GPP concepts correctly, even if with an operator-defined 5QI value. |

[Instance-2372-5771] | 3 | This aligns with the AI/ML-driven management vision of 3GPP (e.g., NWDAF). However, `lstm_with_attention_mechanism` is a very specific, non-standard ML model name. "Deep learning for intelligent network optimization" is also a very high-level concept. | 4 | The intent specifies a sophisticated neural network architecture and links it to cognitive assurance, indicating high complexity. | 3 | The intent is readable but very abstract and jargony.

[Instance-2375-5804] | 4 | EAP-AKA' is a standard authentication method, and 128-NEA2 (SNOW 3G) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple triggers (auth failure, security breach), a specific algorithm, and a secondary notification event (key rotation) with a time period. | 3 | The phrasing is slightly awkward, combining a reactive alert on failures with a proactive notification for a routine event (key rotation) using the word "with". | 5 | The description is clearly a request for notifications and alerts, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 3 | The combination of failure alerts and a scheduled event notification in a single sentence reduces its coherence, as they are distinct notification types. | 3 | Combining reactive, failure-based alerting with proactive, time-based event notification in a single intent is functionally inconsistent. | 3 | The intent specifies the triggers but lacks information on the notification target or channel (e.g., email, SNMP). | 3.6 | A valid notification request that uses correct security terms but is hampered by a slightly incoherent and inconsistent structure. |
| 176 | Performance Assurance Intent | Configure 49ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.000385 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms. | 5 | Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER) are standardized QoS parameters in 3GPP, particularly for 5G QoS Flows (5QI) as defined in TS 23.501. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, providing exact numerical values for both PDB and error rate, and referencing the required underlying mechanisms. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded, technically precise, and easily understandable for network engineers and automation systems. | 5 | This is a classic Performance Assurance Intent, as it aims to configure and guarantee specific QoS characteristics. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, linking the specific QoS parameters to the high-level mechanisms needed to enforce them. | 5 | The specified PDB and error rate are consistent parameters for defining a QoS level, and traffic engineering is the correct mechanism to achieve this. | 5 | The intent is very complete, providing all the key parameters needed to configure a QoS policy for a service. | 5.0 | An outstanding intent that correctly and precisely uses standardized 3GPP QoS terminology to define a clear performance goal. |
| 177 | Modification Intent | Reconfigure Beamforming_8T8R antenna systems with mission-critical 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 93Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance. | 3 | The antenna configuration `Beamforming_8T8R` is not a standard term; it's likely a mix of `Beamforming` and `MIMO_8T8R`. The other concepts (3D Beamforming, backhaul) are valid. | 4 | The intent is complex, involving modifications to antenna configuration, beamforming, and a related transport network parameter. | 4 | The intent is mostly clear, but the non-standard antenna terminology is confusing. | 5 | The action "Reconfigure" makes this a clear Modification Intent. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking RAN changes to backhaul enhancements with the goal of improving performance. | 4 | While RAN and backhaul are distinct domains, modifying them together for a common goal is a consistent and practical approach to network optimization. | 4 | The intent is specific but could be more complete by detailing what "optimization" and "enhancement" entail. | 4.0 | A good, practical intent that is marred by non-standard terminology for the antenna system. |
| 178 | Deployment Intent | Monitor security events using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with 4minutes/11minutes/29minutes escalation policies, ensuring rapid response to security incidents. | 4 | Using ML models like Isolation Forest for security event monitoring is a valid, modern approach (conceptually aligned with NWDAF/SEPP). Escalation policies are a standard operational concept. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying the detection algorithm, a three-tier escalation policy, and the overall goal. | 5 | The intent is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 4 | This is borderline. "Monitor" suggests assurance, but since it's about deploying a new monitoring *system* with specific policies, it can be considered a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, linking the detection method to the response policy and the security objective. | 5 | Using anomaly detection to trigger an escalation policy is a perfectly consistent security workflow. | 4 | The intent is very good but could be more complete by specifying what "security events" or data sources to monitor. | 4.4 | A strong intent that clearly describes the deployment of a security monitoring and response workflow, though its classification could also be 'Performance Assurance'. |
| 179 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-2379-5831] | 4 | Throughput and latency are standard 3GPP performance indicators. "CPU_BASED intelligent scaling" is a plausible implementation detail for NFV infrastructure. The repetition of "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying exact performance targets for both throughput and latency, and naming a specific scaling mechanism. | 3 | The readability is slightly reduced by the redundant phrase "high-throughput high-capacity". | 5 | The goal is to achieve specific performance targets (throughput, latency), which is a clear Performance Assurance Intent. | 4 | The intent is coherent, linking the performance goals to the mechanism intended to achieve them. | 4 | There can be a trade-off between high throughput and ultra-low latency, making them potentially inconsistent goals if not carefully managed. Naming a scaling mechanism helps, but the challenge remains. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete but could benefit from specifying the context (e.g., for a specific slice or service). | 4.0 | A strong performance intent with specific, ambitious targets, though the phrasing is slightly redundant and the goals could be conflicting. |

It correctly identifies a 3GPP NF (UPF), a real-world vendor, and specifies the complete hardware and software stack, which aligns with ETSI NFV principles. | 5 | The intent is highly detailed, specifying the NF, vendor, software version, CPU architecture, core count, memory size/type, and storage size/type. | 5 | The intent is exceptionally clear, specific, and provides a full picture of the deployment request. | 5 | The action "Deploy...UPF" is a perfect match for a Deployment Intent. | 5 | The sentence is perfectly coherent, describing the what, how, and on what for the deployment. | 5 | All the specified components are consistent with a modern, virtualized UPF deployment. The resources are small but plausible for a small-scale or edge UPF. | 5 | This intent is fully complete and actionable by an orchestration system. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a real-world deployment intent. It is comprehensive, clear, and technically sound. |
| 181 | Performance Assurance Intent | Monitor network performance using LSTM_Autoencoder behavioral anomaly detection with Neural_Network predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. [Instance-2381-5893] | 4 | The application of ML models like LSTM Autoencoder and Neural Networks for anomaly detection and prediction is aligned with 3GPP NWDAF concepts (TS 23.288), though the models themselves are not standardized terms. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying distinct ML models for different tasks (anomaly detection vs. prediction) and linking them to a high-level goal. | 4 | The sentence is well-structured and grammatically correct, though it is dense with technical jargon. | 5 | The description directly addresses the goal of performance assurance through monitoring and proactive management. | 5 | The components of the intent are logically connected, starting from the method (ML models) to the outcome (proactive management). | 5 | Using fault-tolerant anomaly detection with predictive analytics is a consistent and standard approach for proactive network assurance. | 3 | The intent is conceptually complete but lacks specific KPIs or network segments to monitor, making it a high-level goal rather than a precise instruction. | 4.4 | A strong, complex intent that clearly articulates a modern, ML-driven approach to performance assurance, though it lacks specific metrics. |
| 182 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF deterministic performance analytics report analyzing 16 core utilization and 241GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | The intent is well-aligned with 3GPP standards, correctly identifying the AMF, using standard metrics, and referencing "deterministic performance." | 5 | The intent is very specific, providing the NF, precise resource figures, the type of analysis, and the required output. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and easily parsable, making it suitable for automation. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a performance analytics report, matching the intent type exactly. | 5 | The intent is coherently structured, outlining the required action, its parameters, and the desired result in a logical flow. | 5 | The intent is internally consistent, linking the analysis of performance metrics to the goal of resource optimization. | 5 | With all key parameters specified, this intent is complete and immediately actionable. | 5.0 | An excellent, well-formed intent that correctly combines a request for a report with the specific context of deterministic performance. |

[Instance-2384-5942] | 4 | URLLC and deterministic performance are core 3GPP concepts. Using an LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection is a valid, modern technique aligned with NWDAF. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying the service type to monitor (URLLC), the monitoring technique (LSTM Autoencoder), the trigger condition (performance degradation), and the action (alerting). | 3 | The readability is impaired by the repetitive "ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency" and the slightly convoluted sentence structure. | 5 | The intent's goal is to configure monitoring and proactive alerting, which fits the Regular Notification Request type. | 4 | The intent is coherent but would be clearer with more streamlined phrasing. | 5 | Using anomaly detection on a URLLC slice to alert on performance degradation is a perfectly consistent and crucial monitoring strategy. | 4 | The intent is very well-specified but could be more complete by defining the specific KPIs that constitute "deterministic performance degradation." | 4.3 | A strong, technically sophisticated intent for monitoring a URLLC slice that is only slightly weakened by repetitive phrasing. |
| 185 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate AUSF deployment through nfvo_d44f61355024 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_b2a036ea3ea1 VNF Manager integration. | 5 | This intent correctly references the AUSF (a 3GPP 5G core NF), and the NFVO and VNFM, which are key components of the ETSI NFV MANO framework. | 4 | The intent is complex as it specifies the NF to be deployed (AUSF) and the specific management and orchestration entities by their identifiers. | 5 | The sentence is very clear, well-structured, and directly consumable by an orchestration system. | 5 | This is a classic deployment intent, instructing the orchestration of a network function through a specific management framework. | 5 | The instruction is perfectly coherent, describing a standard workflow for deploying a virtualized network function. | 5 | The roles of AUSF, NFVO, and VNFM are described in a way that is perfectly consistent with ETSI NFV architecture. | 4 | The intent is actionable but could be more complete by including configuration details for the AUSF itself. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-aligned intent describing a typical VNF deployment process through an NFV orchestrator. |
| 186 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 74GB DDR4 memory and 9492GB NVMe_SSD storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 4 | The resources (DDR4, NVMe SSD) are standard infrastructure components. The request for a "performance impact analysis" is a valid and critical step. | 4 | The intent specifies memory/storage types and sizes and asks for a complex impact analysis. | 5 | The request is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. | 5 | The verb "Evaluate" and the mention of "impact analysis" clearly align this with an Intent Feasibility Check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, asking for an evaluation of resource requirements and the performance impact of using those specific resources. | 5 | It is consistent to evaluate the performance impact of specific hardware. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because it doesn't specify for which network function or service these resources are being evaluated. | 4.4 | A good feasibility check for hardware components, but it critically lacks the context of the intended application or network function. |
| 187 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using EAP_TLS authentication and 256_NEA2 encryption with 3hours automated key management. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a standard authentication protocol. However, 256-NEA2 is not a standard 5G algorithm name (3GPP specifies 128-bit NAS encryption algorithms, including 128-NEA2). | 4 | The intent specifies the authentication method, a non-standard encryption algorithm, and a specific policy for key management. | 4 | The intent is clear and easy to understand, despite the non-standard term. | 5 | The goal is to "secure performance assurance," which is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | The intent is coherent, listing the specific security mechanisms that will be used to achieve the assurance goal. | 4 | The use of a non-standard encryption algorithm name is an inconsistency.

However, 256-NEA1 is not a standard 5G algorithm name. The overall goal is valid. | 4 | The intent specifies a broad security framework implementation, including authentication and a non-standard encryption algorithm. | 2 | The readability is poor due to the jargony, repetitive "mission-critical research-grade sophisticated" qualifier. | 5 | The intent to "Implement...framework" is a clear Deployment Intent. | 3 | The sentence is coherent in its goal, but the excessive adjectives make it clunky. | 4 | The use of a non-standard encryption algorithm name is an inconsistency. | 3 | The intent is very high-level. "Comprehensive framework" and "all network communications" are too broad to be actionable without further scoping. | 3.6 | A conceptually valid but poorly written intent that uses excessive jargon and non-standard terms, and is too high-level to be actionable. |
