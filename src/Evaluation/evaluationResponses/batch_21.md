| 11 | Intent Feasibility Check | Consider 130994_devices_per_km2 device high-density support and Certificate_Based/256_NEA2 security overhead impact on system performance and scalability. | 4 | Device density is a key mMTC metric (TS 22.261). Certificate-based authentication is valid. `256_NEA2` is non-standard; 3GPP's `NEA2` is 128-bit AES.

| 13 | Deployment Intent | Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 1Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 406.44ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics. | 3 | Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB) are standard QoS parameters (TS 23.501). However, calling a service with a ~400ms delay budget "mission-critical" is a contradiction. Mission-critical usually implies very low latency. | 4 | Specifies multiple QoS parameters (priority, GBR, PDB) and performance characteristics for a new service. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the term "mission-critical" conflicts with the provided delay budget. | 5 | The instruction to "Launch... network service" is a clear `Deployment Intent`. | 4 | The intent is coherent in its structure, but the combination of "mission-critical" and a high delay budget is logically questionable. | 2 | There is a significant contradiction between "mission-critical" and a 406.44ms packet delay budget. | 5 | Provides a full set of QoS parameters for deploying a service slice. | 3.9 | A well-structured intent for service deployment that is undermined by a significant contradiction in its QoS descriptors. |
| 14 | Modification Intent | Update QoS flow 5QI_75_V2X_Messages configuration with 1063Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality. | 4 | `5QI` (5G QoS Identifier) is a standard concept. 5QI 75 is a standardized value for V2X messages.

| 18 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using fault-tolerant EAP_TLS authentication frameworks and 128_NEA1 encryption protocols with mission-criticalout compromising performance characteristics. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a standard authentication framework. `128_NEA1` (SNOW 3G) is a valid 3GPP encryption algorithm. The phrase "mission-criticalout" appears to be a typo for "mission-critical without". | 4 | Specifies security mechanisms and links them to high-level goals of fault tolerance, performance, and mission-criticality. | 3 | The intent is mostly readable, but the typo "mission-criticalout" hinders clarity. | 5 | The goal to "Secure high-performance infrastructure" is a clear `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 4 | The intent is coherent, though the typo slightly disrupts the flow. | 5 | The security and performance goals are consistent with a robust network design. | 4 | Specifies the security protocols but lacks concrete performance targets. | 4.1 | A good intent focused on secure performance, though it is slightly marred by a typographical error. |

[Instance-4021-5331] | 4 | Uses standard KPIs (throughput, latency) with values appropriate for high-performance use cases. "CPU_BASED scaling" is a valid implementation strategy. The redundant "high-throughput high-capacity" is a minor flaw. | 4 | Specifies performance targets and the method to achieve them. | 4 | The intent is clear, but the redundant phrasing ("high-throughput high-capacity") is slightly awkward. | 5 | The goal to "Implement high-performance networking achieving" specific KPIs is a `Performance Assurance Intent`. | 5 | The intent coherently connects the desired performance outcomes with an enabling mechanism. | 5 | The specified throughput and latency are consistent with a high-performance goal. | 4 | The intent provides clear targets but does not name the specific service or slice it applies to. | 4.4 | A strong intent for performance assurance with clear KPIs, despite minor redundant wording. |

| 25 | Modification Intent | Adjust compute resources to 103 processing cores and 26GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency. | 4 | Resource allocation is a standard NFV concept. The ratio of cores to memory (103 cores to 26GB RAM) is highly unusual for typical NFs, which are often memory-intensive, but could be plausible for a specialized compute-heavy task. | 3 | Specifies multiple concrete parameters for a resource adjustment. The core-to-memory ratio is unconventional. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and easy to parse, despite the unusual resource ratio. | 5 | "Adjust compute resources" is a direct expression of a `Modification Intent`. | 5 | The structure logically connects the resource change to the performance and cost goals. | 3 | The extremely high core count relative to the low memory allocation is internally inconsistent for most common network functions. | 4 | It specifies the resources but not the target network function or application. | 4.1 | A well-structured intent, but the specified resource ratio is highly atypical and likely inconsistent for a general-purpose NF. |
