| 195 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 361GB DDR5 memory and 1326GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 3 | While the hardware is standard (DDR5), the intent lacks a direct link to 3GPP network functions or services. | 3 | The task involves performance analysis, but the parameters themselves are just hardware specifications. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased and easy to understand. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Evaluate," which aligns perfectly with the 'Intent Feasibility Check' type. | 4 | The intent is coherent in its request but would be more logical if it specified what workload the resources are for. | 5 | The components of the evaluation (memory, storage, performance impact) are consistent with each other. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which NF or application these resources are for, making a feasibility check difficult. | 4.0 | A clear but incomplete feasibility check, as it lacks the context of the workload or service being evaluated. |
| 196 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 125 processing cores and 198GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Pertains to resource allocation for the core network, but "core network" is broad. Transport optimization is a valid concept. | 4 | Involves modifying resources for the entire core network and coupling it with transport optimization, making it a complex, high-impact change. | 4 | The intent is reasonably clear but could be more specific about which part of the core network is being modified. | 5 | The request to "Modify... allocation" is a clear modification intent. | 4 | The link between adjusting compute cores and "transport network optimization" is logical but very high-level. | 5 | The specified resource modifications and optimization goal are consistent with network management. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because "core network" is too generic. It should specify the NF or service. | 4.1 | A high-level modification intent that is clear but too broad to be directly actionable. |
| 197 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade PCF network function using Samsung SW_1.7.401 software on high-performance 7-core ARM64 architecture with 3GB DDR5 memory and 229GB SATA_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | This is a perfect deployment intent. It correctly identifies a 5G NF (PCF) and provides a full, realistic manifest of software, hardware, and storage for its deployment. | 5 | While the individual components are standard, specifying a full deployment stack from software version to storage type makes this a complex, detailed instruction. | 5 | The intent is extremely clear, specific, and provides all the necessary information for a deployment action. | 5 | The request to "Deploy" a specific network function with a full hardware/software bill of materials is the epitome of a 'Deployment Intent'. | 5 | The intent logically and completely describes the deployment package for the PCF. | 5 | All specified components (enterprise-grade PCF, Samsung SW, ARM64, DDR5, SATA SSD) are consistent and form a plausible real-world deployment scenario. | 5 | The intent is exceptionally complete, leaving no ambiguity for the orchestrator. | 5.0 | A perfect, real-world example of a detailed and actionable deployment intent for a 5G network function. |
| 198 | Modification Intent | Adjust Beamforming_8T8R radio parameters and Vertical_Beamforming beamforming configuration with core network coordination. | 5 | Uses standard and correct 5G RAN terminology (Beamforming, 8T8R). The need for coordination with the core network is also a valid operational concept. | 4 | The intent involves modifying multiple radio parameters and requires coordination, making it a complex operation. | 5 | The instruction is clear and specific about what needs to be adjusted and the required coordination. | 5 | The description "Adjust... radio parameters" is a clear directive for modification, fitting the intent type perfectly. | 5 | The intent logically connects the radio parameter adjustments with the need for core network coordination. | 5 | All elements of the modification request are consistent and relevant to RAN optimization. | 4 | While specific on what to change, it lacks the target values or goal for the adjustment (e.g., "to improve coverage in sector X"). | 4.7 | A specific and technically correct modification intent, slightly lacking a defined end-goal. |
| 199 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation monitoring with mission-critical Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. | 5 | Correctly identifies a 3GPP use case (V2X) and applies modern, relevant techniques (anomaly detection) for its monitoring. | 5 | This is a highly complex notification setup, requiring the configuration of an ML-based anomaly detection system for a mission-critical service. | 5 | The intent is well-structured and clear. | 4 | While it says "Configure," the end result is "proactive alerting," making it an advanced notification request. The fit is good. | 5 | It logically connects the service type (V2X), the monitoring goal, the method (anomaly detection), and the action (alerting). | 5 | The use of Isolation Forest for anomaly detection in V2X traffic patterns is a consistent and appropriate technical choice. | 5 | The intent is very complete, specifying the what, why, and how of the monitoring and alerting configuration. | 4.9 | A sophisticated, standards-relevant intent for establishing an intelligent monitoring and alerting system for V2X services. |
| 200 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 119 RISC_V processing cores at 3.52GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly identifies a key 5G NF (AMF) and assesses its feasibility on an emerging, relevant hardware architecture (RISC-V) at a very large scale. | 5 | This is a highly complex check, requiring deep knowledge of the AMF's workload and the performance of the RISC-V architecture at a specific, large-scale configuration. | 5 | The request is very clear, specific, and uses standard technical terminology. | 5 | The request to "Assess... feasibility" is a direct match for the intent type. | 5 | It logically connects the NF (AMF) to the target hardware platform and the evaluation criteria. | 5 | The parameters (NF, CPU cores, architecture, clock speed) are all consistent and relevant for a deployment feasibility study. | 5 | The intent is complete and provides all necessary information to initiate the assessment. | 5.0 | An excellent, realistic, and forward-looking feasibility check for a large-scale 5G NF deployment on an emerging architecture. |
