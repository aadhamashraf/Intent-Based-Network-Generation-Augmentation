| 32 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using EAP_TLS authentication frameworks and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-2632-7376] | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication protocol. However, "256_NEA2" is a slight inconsistency. 3GPP defines 128-bit algorithms for NAS (128-NEA2 is SNOW 3G). 256-bit algorithms exist for other layers, but the "NEA" naming is specific to NAS. Assuming it means a 256-bit variant, it's conceptually valid. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying authentication and encryption protocols, a priority level, and a performance constraint. | 4 | The phrase "high-priorityout" seems to be a typo for "high-priority without". This slightly impacts readability. | 5 | The intent is to "Secure high-performance infrastructure," which is a key aspect of assuring performance. | 5 | The intent's structure is logical, defining the security mechanisms and the performance constraint. | 4 | The typo and the slight ambiguity of "256_NEA2" reduce consistency, but the overall goal is coherent. | 4 | The intent is quite complete, specifying the security protocols to be used. | 4.3 | A strong intent that correctly specifies security mechanisms for performance assurance, with minor issues in terminology and phrasing. |
| 33 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous performance optimization using lstm_with_attention_mechanism machine learning models with 86.11% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 5 | Using ML models like LSTM for predictive network management is aligned with 3GPP's NWDAF concept. Specifying a prediction accuracy target is a standard practice in ML projects. | 5 | The intent is complex, specifying a particular ML model, a precise accuracy target, and the application domain (intelligent network management). | 5 | The language is technical but clear. The use of underscores is suitable for machine parsing. | 5 | The goal of "autonomous performance optimization" is a core tenet of performance assurance. | 5 | The sentence logically connects the method (ML model) with its performance metric (accuracy) and its purpose. | 5 | The specified ML model and accuracy target are consistent with the goal of implementing an intelligent optimization system. | 4 | The intent is specific about the 'how' but not the 'what'—it doesn't state which network KPI is being optimized. | 4.9 | A sophisticated and technically specific intent that accurately reflects the use of AI/ML in modern network operations. |
| 34 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 386GB DDR5 memory and 2738GB NVMe_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 5 | The intent specifies modern, real-world hardware (DDR5, NVMe SSD) and requests a standard analysis (performance impact), which is a valid and relevant feasibility check. | 4 | It provides specific memory/storage types and sizes and requests a "mission-critical" analysis, making it a detailed check. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The action "Evaluate... requirements" directly fits the Intent Feasibility Check type. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, specifying what to evaluate and the type of analysis required. | 5 | The combination of large amounts of fast DDR5 memory and NVMe storage is consistent with a mission-critical, high-performance system. | 4 | The intent is complete for a hardware check, but lacks context on the workload it's intended for. | 4.7 | A clear, technically specific, and relevant intent for assessing high-performance hardware configurations. |
| 35 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 128_NEA3 encryption protocols with high-priorityout compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-2635-7401] | 5 | Certificate-based authentication is a standard security practice. 128-NEA3 (using the ZUC algorithm) is a standardized 5G NAS encryption protocol (3GPP TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies authentication and encryption protocols, priority, and a performance constraint, making it complex. | 4 | The phrase "high-priorityout" appears to be a typo for "high-priority without," which slightly hurts readability. | 5 | Securing the infrastructure is a critical part of assuring its performance and reliability. | 5 | The intent logically defines the security measures to be implemented and the associated performance goal. | 5 | The chosen security protocols are valid and consistent with securing a high-performance 5G environment. | 4 | The intent is complete in specifying the security configuration. | 4.6 | A strong and standards-aligned intent for securing infrastructure, with a minor typo being the only flaw. |
| 36 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize deterministic performance achieving 730ms response time with predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 5 | The concept of "deterministic performance" is key for URLLC services. Applying predictive analytics and automated remediation (from ETSI ZSM) to achieve this is a valid and modern approach. | 4 | It combines a specific performance type (deterministic), a metric (response time), and advanced operational methods. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated and easy to understand. | 5 | The goal is to "Optimize deterministic performance," which is a specific type of performance assurance. | 5 | The sentence logically connects the performance goal with the target metric and the methods to be used. | 5 | A 730ms response time is not particularly "deterministic" in the URLLC sense (which is usually single-digit ms), but as a target for a less critical service, it is a consistent goal for optimization. | 3 | The intent lacks context on the service for which this "deterministic" performance is required. | 4.6 | A well-phrased intent that correctly uses modern terminology, although the response time value is unusually high for a "deterministic" service. |
| 37 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS is a valid authentication method, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a valid 5G encryption algorithm. However, combining failure alerts with routine event notifications (key rotation) in one sentence is slightly incoherent. | 4 | The intent is complex as it defines multiple trigger conditions (auth failure, breach) and also includes information about a separate, scheduled event (key rotation). | 4 | The phrasing is a bit ambiguous; it could be interpreted as "alert on failures" AND "notify on key rotation," or that the key rotation notification is somehow linked to the failures. | 5 | The primary purpose is to request alerts and notifications. | 4 | The sentence structure is somewhat confusing due to the combination of reactive alerts and proactive notifications. | 3 | It's inconsistent to mix urgent, high-priority failure alerts with a routine 24-hour key rotation notification in the same instruction. | 4 | It specifies the conditions for alerting but could be clearer in separating the different notification types. | 4.0 | The intent correctly identifies relevant security events for notification but suffers from a confusing sentence structure that combines different types of alerts. |
| 38 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 128_NEA1 encryption protocols with mission-criticalout compromising performance characteristics. | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication framework for 5G, and 128-NEA1 (AES) is a standard encryption algorithm (TS 33.501). Mentioning fault-tolerance and performance is highly relevant. | 4 | This is a complex intent specifying authentication, encryption, a resilience characteristic (fault-tolerant), priority, and a performance constraint. | 4 | The typo "mission-criticalout" for "mission-critical without" slightly impacts readability. | 5 | Securing the infrastructure is a core component of ensuring its overall performance and reliability. | 5 | The intent is logically structured, defining the security measures and the performance-related constraints. | 5 | The use of 5G-AKA and 128-NEA1 is the standard, consistent choice for securing a 5G network. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying all the necessary security parameters for the configuration. | 4.7 | An excellent, standards-aligned intent for implementing baseline 5G security with a clear focus on resilience and performance. |
| 39 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 138GB LPDDR5 memory and 8221GB SATA_SSD storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 5 | LPDDR5 and SATA SSD are valid technologies. Requesting a performance impact analysis, especially for "deterministic performance" (relevant to URLLC), is a valid feasibility check. | 4 | It specifies exact memory/storage sizes and types and asks for a specific type of analysis (deterministic performance). | 5 | The intent is clearly stated with precise technical details. | 5 | The action "Evaluate... requirements" is the definition of a feasibility check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, outlining the hardware to be evaluated and the specific analytical goal. | 4 | Using LPDDR5 (low-power, for mobile) with a very large SATA SSD is a slightly unusual combination for a high-performance server, but not impossible. NVMe would be more consistent with the performance goal. | 4 | The intent is complete for a hardware check but lacks the workload context. | 4.6 | A good, specific feasibility check intent, though the hardware combination is slightly unconventional. |
| 40 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 4hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | 5G-AKA and 128-NEA1 are correct 5G security protocols. As before, mixing urgent failure alerts with routine key rotation notifications in a single phrase is slightly incoherent. | 4 | The intent defines multiple triggers (auth failure, breach) and includes a separate, frequent event notification (4-hour key rotation), making it complex. | 4 | The phrasing is ambiguous. It's unclear if the key rotation is just another event to notify on, or if it's related to the failure alerts. | 5 | The core request is for alerts and notifications. | 4 | The sentence structure is confusing because it merges an alert policy with a notification policy. | 3 | Mixing mission-critical failure alerts with a very frequent (every 4 hours) but routine key rotation notification is inconsistent in terms of priority and handling. | 4 | The intent specifies alert triggers but could be structured more clearly. | 4.0 | This intent correctly identifies important security events but is structured in a confusing way, conflating different notification types. |
| 41 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 11hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS and 128-NEA3 (ZUC) are valid security protocols. The intent suffers from the same structural issue of mixing failure alerts with routine event notifications. | 4 | It specifies multiple alert triggers and includes information about a scheduled notification, making it complex. | 4 | The ambiguous phrasing makes it hard to determine the exact relationship between the failure alerts and the key rotation notifications. | 5 | The intent is fundamentally a request for notifications. | 4 | The combination of different notification types in one clause reduces coherence. | 3 | The intent inconsistently mixes reactive, high-priority alerts with a proactive, routine notification. | 4 | It specifies the events but the structure makes the desired logic unclear. | 4.0 | This intent correctly uses security terminology but is poorly structured, leading to ambiguity. |
| 42 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 37 x86_64 processing cores at 3.48GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid feasibility check for deploying a 5G NF (AMF) on standard hardware (x86_64), which is a key process in network service management. | 4 | The request is technically specific, including priority, core count, architecture, and clock speed for the assessment. | 5 | The intent is stated in clear, direct language. | 5 | The description's action is to "Assess... feasibility," which is the definition of the intent type. | 5 | The request is logical, outlining the subject (AMF), the resources, and the assessment criteria. | 5 | The specified hardware resources are consistent with a medium-to-large scale AMF deployment. | 5 | The intent provides sufficient information to perform a meaningful feasibility study. | 4.9 | An excellent example of a clear, specific, and actionable feasibility check intent. |
| 43 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Genetic_Algorithm intelligent insights with mission-critical 332days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 5 | Using ML/AI (Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm, plausible for optimization) for "intelligent insights" aligns with the goals of 3GPP's NWDAF. Basing alerts on long-term historical trends is a valid analytics-driven approach. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying an AI technique, a fault-tolerance requirement, a very long historical analysis window, and the type of notification (trend-based). | 5 | The language is technical but clear and describes a sophisticated notification strategy. | 5 | The intent is to set up a system to "Alert" based on specific analytical triggers. | 5 | The sentence coherently describes a process: using an algorithm on historical data to generate trend-based alerts. | 5 | All components (genetic algorithm for insights, long-term data analysis, trend-based notifications) are consistent with an advanced, proactive monitoring system. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing a clear picture of the desired intelligent notification system. | 5.0 | A sophisticated and forward-looking intent that perfectly captures the concept of AI-driven, proactive network notifications. |
| 44 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with mission-critical Vertical_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 6Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | All terms are standard in RAN engineering. Traditional MIMO 4T4R is a common configuration, Vertical Beamforming is a valid technique, and backhaul capacity is a critical parameter. | 5 | The intent is complex, involving the modification of three distinct but related RAN parameters: antenna system configuration, beamforming technique, and backhaul capacity. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased, technically precise, and easy for a RAN engineer or automation system to understand. | 5 | The action "Reconfigure" is a direct match for a Modification Intent. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, describing the system to be reconfigured, the specific changes to be made, and the intended outcome. | 5 | Optimizing beamforming and enhancing backhaul capacity are consistent actions for improving coverage and performance of a MIMO system. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the target system and the exact changes to be implemented. | 5.0 | An excellent, technically precise, and actionable intent for RAN optimization. |
| 45 | Deployment Intent | "Provision edge computing resources featuring 5 processing cores and 2GB memory allocation, optimized for distributed computing workloads and real-time data analytics." | 5 | Provisioning resources for edge computing is a standard deployment action in 5G and MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) architectures. | 3 | The intent is simple, specifying only core and memory allocation for a general purpose. | 5 | The language is clear and concise. | 5 | The action "Provision... resources" is a deployment activity. | 5 | The sentence clearly states what resources to provision and for what purpose. | 3 | The resource allocation of 5 cores to only 2GB of memory is highly unusual. Most workloads require significantly more memory per core. This is a potential inconsistency. | 4 | The intent is actionable but the unusual resource ratio might require clarification. | 4.3 | A clear deployment intent that is slightly marred by an unconventional and potentially inconsistent resource allocation ratio. |
| 46 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy intelligent edge massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems infrastructure with high-priority DISTRIBUTED deployment strategy supporting 830670_devices_per_km2 device massive connectivity high-density, enabling ultra-low latency applications and local data processing." | 5 | This intent correctly describes a 5G mMTC (massive Machine-Type Communications) service. The device density is high, as expected for mMTC. The mention of distributed edge and low latency is also relevant for IoT use cases. | 5 | This is a very complex intent, defining the service type (mMTC), priority, deployment model (distributed), a specific KPI (device density), and enabling other characteristics (low latency). | 4 | The sentence is a bit long and dense with keywords like "massive connectivity high-density," but the overall meaning is clear. | 5 | The core action is to "Deploy" an infrastructure. | 5 | The intent is coherently structured, describing the service, its deployment, its key performance characteristic, and its benefits. | 5 | All the described characteristics—mMTC, high density, distributed edge, low latency—are consistent with an advanced IoT/5G deployment. | 5 | The intent provides a very complete and detailed description of the service to be deployed. | 4.9 | An excellent and detailed intent that accurately captures the requirements for deploying a large-scale mMTC/IoT service. |
| 47 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 18Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 2.24ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | The intent correctly uses 3GPP QoS terminology: Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB). The values (18Mbps, 2.24ms) are plausible for a URLLC or a high-performance industrial service. | 4 | It specifies multiple, precise QoS parameters and performance characteristics, making it a detailed service definition. | 4 | The repetition of "critical priority" and "mission-critical" is slightly redundant but does not obscure the clear technical request. | 5 | "Launch... network service" is a deployment action. | 5 | The sentence is logically structured, defining the service, its QoS guarantees, and its purpose. | 5 | A guaranteed bitrate and a strict, low packet delay budget are consistent with a mission-critical, deterministic service. | 5 | The intent provides the key QoS parameters required to configure and launch the network service slice. | 4.9 | A strong, specific, and standards-aligned intent for launching a QoS-sensitive network service. |
| 48 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 338GB DDR5 memory and 3235GB NVMe_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 5 | This is a valid feasibility check using modern hardware components (DDR5, NVMe SSD). Requesting a mission-critical performance impact analysis is a standard part of planning for critical services. | 4 | It specifies exact memory/storage sizes and types and asks for a high-stakes performance analysis. | 5 | The intent is clearly worded and technically precise. | 5 | The action "Evaluate... requirements" is a feasibility check. | 5 | The sentence is coherent, specifying the hardware to be evaluated and the goal of the analysis. | 5 | The combination of a large amount of fast DDR5 memory and NVMe storage is consistent with a mission-critical performance goal. | 4 | The intent is complete for a hardware evaluation but does not specify the intended workload. | 4.7 | A clear and technically relevant feasibility check for a high-performance hardware setup. |
| 49 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 6 processing cores and 230GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | This intent aligns with standard NFV resource management procedures for modifying the resources allocated to a virtualized function. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, precise parameters (cores, memory, timeout) and objectives, making it complex. | 5 | The description is well-structured and provides exact values, making it ideal for automation. | 5 | The action "Adjust compute resources" is a clear modification. | 5 | The sentence flows logically from the action to the parameters, constraints, and goals. | 5 | All parameters are consistent with a resource modification task for a memory-intensive, mission-critical application. | 5 | The intent is highly complete, providing all necessary parameters for an orchestrator to execute the change. | 4.9 | An excellent, specific, and actionable modification intent with clear parameters and objectives. |
| 50 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 15hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-TLS and 128-NEA1 (AES) are valid security protocols. The intent has the same structural flaw of mixing urgent, reactive alerts with routine, proactive notifications. | 4 | It specifies multiple alert triggers and includes information about a scheduled notification, making it complex. | 4 | The ambiguous phrasing makes it difficult to parse the exact logic intended. | 5 | The intent is a request for alerts and notifications. | 4 | The combination of different notification types in a single clause reduces coherence. | 3 | Inconsistently mixes high-priority failure alerts with a routine key rotation notification. | 4 | It specifies the events for notification but the structure is unclear. | 4.0 | The intent correctly identifies relevant security events but is formulated in a confusing way. |
| 51 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 11 RISC_V processing cores at 2.99GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | This is a valid feasibility check. RISC-V is an emerging open-standard CPU architecture, and assessing its feasibility for a 5G NF like AMF is a relevant and forward-looking task. | 4 | The request is technically specific, including core count, a non-traditional architecture (RISC-V), and clock speed. | 5 | The intent is stated in clear, direct language. | 5 | The description's action is to "Assess... feasibility." | 5 | The request is logical and coherent. | 5 | The specified hardware resources are consistent with a potential deployment scenario for an AMF. | 5 | The intent provides sufficient information to perform the requested feasibility study. | 4.9 | An excellent and forward-looking feasibility check that correctly applies the concept to an emerging hardware architecture. |
| 52 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade UPF network function using fault-tolerant Ericsson SW_2.6.816 software on high-performance 3-core x86_64 architecture with mission-critical 25GB DDR5 memory and 225GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | This intent correctly specifies a 5G NF (UPF), a plausible vendor/software, and a complete set of valid, high-performance hardware components (x86_64, DDR5, NVMe SSD). | 5 | This is a highly complex and detailed intent, specifying the NF, software, resilience, CPU, memory, and storage details. | 5 | The description is information-dense but clear and well-structured. | 5 | The primary action is to "Deploy" a network function. | 5 | The sentence is logically constructed, detailing all components of the deployment. | 5 | All specified components are consistent with a modern, high-performance UPF deployment, which is a data-plane intensive function. | 5 | This intent is extremely complete, providing a full manifest for the deployment. | 5.0 | A perfect example of a comprehensive, technically detailed, and actionable deployment intent for a critical 5G component. |
| 53 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with 10hours automated key management. | 4 | 5G-AKA is correct. "256_NEA1" is slightly inconsistent, as 3GPP's NAS encryption algorithm NEA1 (AES) is 128-bit. A 256-bit AES cipher is standard, but the "NEA" nomenclature is specific. Automated key management (rotation) is a standard practice. | 4 | It specifies authentication, encryption, key size, and a key management policy, making it complex. | 5 | The intent is clear and technically specific. | 5 | The goal is to "Secure performance assurance," which fits the intent type as security is a prerequisite for assurance. | 5 | The sentence logically links the security protocols with the management policy. | 4 | The slight inconsistency in the "256_NEA1" naming reduces the score, but the overall intent is coherent. | 5 | The intent is complete for defining a security policy. | 4.6 | A strong security intent with a minor terminological inconsistency regarding the encryption algorithm naming. |
| 54 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 2minutes/10minutes/21minutes multi-tier escalation through SNMP notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 4 | SNMP is a standard notification protocol, and multi-tier escalation is a common operational practice. "Intelligent routing" is a plausible, if generic, concept. | 4 | The intent is complex, defining a three-stage escalation timeline, a protocol (SNMP), and a routing requirement. | 5 | The request is clear and provides a parsable structure for the escalation timeline. | 5 | The intent is to "Implement... escalation," which fits the notification request type. | 5 | The sentence logically defines the escalation path, channel, and an associated requirement. | 5 | The specified escalation times and use of SNMP are consistent with a structured notification policy. | 5 | The intent is complete for defining this specific escalation policy. | 4.7 | A practical and well-defined intent for establishing a multi-tier notification and escalation procedure. |
| 55 | Regular Notification Request | Implement 3minutes/7minutes/21minutes multi-tier escalation through REST_API notification channels with mission-critical intelligent routing. | 5 | Using REST APIs for notifications is a modern and very common practice, especially in cloud-native environments. Multi-tier escalation is a standard operational procedure. | 4 | The intent is complex, defining a three-stage escalation timeline, the notification method (REST API), and a routing requirement. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and provides a parsable structure for the escalation timeline. | 5 | The intent is to "Implement... escalation," which is a notification request. | 5 | The sentence logically defines the escalation path, channel, and an associated requirement. | 5 | The specified escalation times and the use of REST APIs are consistent with a modern, automated notification policy. | 5 | The intent is complete for defining this specific escalation policy. | 4.9 | An excellent, modern example of a notification intent using REST APIs instead of traditional protocols like SNMP. |
| 56 | Deployment Intent | "Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 7588Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 41.8ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms." | 4 | The intent is to "Optimize" which is typically a modification, but in the context of a network slice, this could be interpreted as deploying an optimized configuration. It correctly uses eMBB concepts and KPIs (throughput, latency). | 4 | It specifies a service type (eMBB), a high throughput target, a latency constraint, and the methods to achieve them, making it quite detailed. | 4 | The repetition of "high-high-throughput" is redundant, but the overall message is clear. | 4 | While it says "Optimize," the context of achieving targets for a slice could be seen as deploying a service with these characteristics. A "Modification Intent" might have been a better fit. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, describing the goal, the KPIs, and the methods. | 5 | The high throughput and latency targets are consistent with an eMBB network slice. | 5 | The intent provides the key performance targets for the network slice deployment/optimization. | 4.6 | A strong intent defining performance goals for a network slice, though the "Deployment" type is slightly questionable as "Modification" could also fit. |
| 57 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with 13hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. "256_NEA2" has a slight inconsistency, as NEA2 (SNOW 3G) is a 128-bit algorithm. The intent also suffers from the structural flaw of mixing failure alerts with routine notifications. | 4 | It specifies multiple alert triggers and includes information about a scheduled notification. | 4 | The ambiguous phrasing makes the intended logic difficult to parse. | 5 | The intent is a request for alerts and notifications. | 4 | The combination of different notification types in one clause reduces coherence. | 3 | It inconsistently mixes high-priority alerts with a routine notification and uses a slightly incorrect term "256_NEA2". | 4 | It specifies the events for notification but the structure is unclear. | 4.0 | The intent uses mostly correct terminology but is poorly structured and contains a minor terminological error. |
| 58 | Intent Report Request | "Analyze network high-throughput performance comparing 1000Mbps target high-throughput against 5ms latency requirements, providing insights into performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. [Instance-2658-7520]" | 5 | The request to analyze and compare key 5G performance metrics (throughput, latency) and identify bottlenecks is a standard and valuable analytics task. | 4 | It asks for a comparative analysis between two specific KPIs and requires a specific type of output (insights, bottlenecks, opportunities), making it a complex request. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated and explains exactly what analysis is needed. | 5 | The action "Analyze... providing insights" is a type of report request. | 5 | The sentence is coherently structured, stating the subject, the comparison criteria, and the desired outcome. | 5 | The performance targets (1000Mbps, 5ms) are consistent with a high-performance network analysis. | 5 | The intent is complete, providing all the necessary context for the analysis. | 4.9 | An excellent example of an analytics-focused report request that goes beyond simple data dumps to ask for actionable insights. |
| 59 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network deterministic performance using One_Class_SVM behavioral anomaly detection with ARIMA predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive deterministic performance management." | 5 | This intent correctly combines multiple relevant concepts: "deterministic performance" (for URLLC), One-Class SVM (a valid ML algorithm for anomaly detection), and ARIMA (a standard statistical method for time series forecasting). This aligns with advanced analytics concepts like NWDAF. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the performance characteristic to monitor, the primary ML algorithm, a secondary predictive model, and the overall management goal. | 5 | The language is technical but clear and well-structured. | 5 | The goal is to "Monitor... enabling proactive... performance management," which is the essence of performance assurance. | 5 | The sentence logically lays out the strategy: monitor a specific performance type using a combination of ML techniques to achieve a proactive goal. | 5 | All the specified techniques (One-Class SVM for anomalies, ARIMA for prediction) are consistent with the goal of proactive performance management. | 5 | The intent provides a complete, high-level description of the desired monitoring and analytics strategy. | 5.0 | A sophisticated and outstanding intent that perfectly describes a modern, AI/ML-driven strategy for proactive performance assurance. |
| 60 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network performance using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with ARIMA predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. [Instance-2660-7538]" | 5 | Similar to the previous intent, this one is also highly valid. Isolation Forest is another well-known and effective algorithm for anomaly detection, and its combination with ARIMA for predictive analytics is a sound approach. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying the ML algorithm for anomaly detection, the model for predictive analytics, and the overall goal. | 5 | The language is technical but clear and well-structured. | 5 | The intent to "Monitor... enabling proactive performance management" is a core performance assurance function. | 5 | The sentence is logically structured, describing the method (Isolation Forest, ARIMA) and the desired outcome. | 5 | The chosen ML techniques are consistent with the goal of proactive performance management. | 5 | The intent provides a complete description of the desired monitoring and analytics strategy. | 5.0 | Another excellent example of a sophisticated intent describing an AI/ML-driven strategy for proactive network monitoring. |
| 61 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_AKA_Prime authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 18hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | EAP-AKA' (Prime) is a valid authentication method. 128-NEA1 is a valid encryption algorithm.
