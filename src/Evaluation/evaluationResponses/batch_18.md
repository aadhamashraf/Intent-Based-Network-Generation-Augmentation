| 5 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 20 RISC_V processing cores at 3.15GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly references a 3GPP NF (AMF) and relevant constraints ("deterministic performance" for URLLC). RISC-V is a valid CPU architecture. | 4 | The request is technically specific, mentioning CPU architecture, core count, and clock speed, which adds significant detail. | 5 | The phrasing is precise and easy to parse for an engineering or automated assessment task. | 5 | The intent explicitly asks to "Assess... feasibility," which directly aligns with the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: assess feasibility of a component (AMF on RISC-V) based on specific criteria (computational/performance needs). | 5 | The parameters are consistent; assessing a specific hardware configuration against performance constraints is a standard feasibility study. | 4 | While specific on hardware, it could be more complete by mentioning expected load or number of subscribers. | 4.7 | A strong, technically specific feasibility check that clearly defines the scope of the assessment. |
| 6 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 97 core utilization and 226GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the 3GPP AMF network function and standard operational metrics. | 4 | Provides specific metrics (core/memory utilization) for a specific NF, making it a detailed request. | 5 | The request is well-formed, clear, and easily parsable. | 5 | The description's primary action is to "Generate a report," which matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent is logically structured: specify the report subject (AMF), the metrics to analyze, and the desired output (recommendations). | 5 | The components of the request are logically connected and consistent. | 5 | This intent is complete, containing all the necessary information to generate the requested report. | 4.9 | Another excellent example of a clear, complete, and actionable report request. |

The device density figure is extremely high but plausible for theoretical analysis. | 5 | This is a highly complex feasibility check, combining device density (mMTC), security protocols, and their joint impact on performance. | 5 | The intent is well-written and clear, despite the technical density of the concepts involved. | 5 | The request to "Consider... impact" is a form of feasibility assessment, aligning well with the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, linking specific conditions (density, security) to the areas of impact to be analyzed (performance, scalability). | 5 | The components are consistent; high device density and security overhead both significantly impact system performance. | 4 | Could be more complete by specifying which system or network function (e.g., AMF, AUSF) is being evaluated. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically deep, and standards-aligned feasibility check that poses a relevant and complex question. |
| 9 | Deployment Intent | "Launch low priority network service guaranteeing 651Mbps guaranteed bitrate with strict 48.38ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | Uses standard 3GPP parameters like Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Packet Delay Budget (PDB). These are defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 for QoS flows. | 4 | The intent is complex, specifying multiple QoS parameters (bitrate, delay budget) and performance characteristics. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and provides specific, machine-readable parameters. | 5 | The description's primary action is to "Launch a service," which is a type of deployment. | 5 | The structure is logical, defining the service type, QoS guarantees, and application support. | 3 | There is a contradiction between "low priority" and the "mission-critical" and "deterministic performance" characteristics, which typically imply high priority. | 4 | It could be more complete by specifying the 5QI (5G QoS Identifier) or the network slice (NSSI) this service belongs to. | 4.4 | A technically sound intent with clear parameters, but the contradiction between "low priority" and "mission-critical" reduces its consistency score. |
| 10 | Performance Assurance Intent | Achieve autonomous performance management with minimal human intervention and intelligent self-optimization. [Instance-3410-1645] | 5 | Aligns perfectly with the high-level goals of ETSI ZSM (Zero-touch network & Service Management) and 3GPP's work on autonomous networks and NWDAF. | 2 | This is a very high-level, strategic intent. It lacks any specific, measurable parameters. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and effectively communicates a strategic goal. | 5 | The description outlines a top-level objective for performance management, which fits the Performance Assurance type. | 5 | The intent is coherent and logically expresses the relationship between autonomy, human intervention, and self-optimization. | 5 | The concepts are internally consistent and mutually supportive. | 2 | As a strategic intent, it is incomplete by design; it lacks specific metrics, thresholds, or targets needed for implementation. | 4.1 | An excellent example of a high-level strategic intent, which would need to be decomposed into more granular intents for execution. |
| 11 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on EAP_TLS authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 7hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | Correctly references 3GPP security mechanisms: EAP-TLS authentication (TS 33.501) and NEA3 encryption algorithm. Key rotation is also a standard security concept. | 4 | The intent combines multiple triggers (authentication failure, breach) and a separate event notification (key rotation), making it moderately complex. | 4 | The phrasing is a bit convoluted. Combining breach alerts with key rotation notifications in one sentence is slightly confusing. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events clearly aligns with a notification request. | 4 | The intent structure is a bit disjointed, mixing reactive alerts (failures, breaches) with a proactive notification (key rotation). | 5 | The specified security mechanisms and events are all consistent within the domain of network security. | 4 | It's unclear if the key rotation is a trigger or just another event to be notified about. Clarifying the relationship would improve it. | 4.4 | A good notification intent with correct technical terms, but its structure could be clearer. |
| 12 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using 5G_AKA authentication and 256_NEA1 encryption with 19hours automated key management. | 4 | Correctly references 5G AKA (TS 33.501), but NEA1 is a 128-bit algorithm, making "256_NEA1" a contradiction. 256-bit algorithms are NEA3, etc. Assuming this is a typo and should be a 256-bit algorithm like NEA3. | 4 | Specifies multiple security parameters (authentication, encryption, key management schedule), giving it good technical depth. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and easy to understand. | 5 | The intent aims to assure performance through specific security configurations, which is a valid type of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically groups together related security functions (authentication, encryption, key management). | 3 | There is a technical inconsistency: NEA1 (EPS Encryption Algorithm 1) is a 128-bit algorithm, so "256_NEA1" is incorrect. | 4 | The intent is fairly complete for defining a security policy but lacks context on where this policy should be applied (e.g., to a specific network slice). | 4.3 | A strong intent that is slightly marred by a technical inaccuracy in the encryption algorithm naming. |
| 13 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 208GB DDR5 memory and 2630GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms. While not 3GPP-specific, they are relevant for deploying virtualized 3GPP network functions. | 3 | The intent specifies hardware types and sizes but does not mention the workload, which is a key variable. | 5 | The request is clear, direct, and unambiguous. | 5 | The description explicitly asks to "Evaluate... requirements," aligning perfectly with a feasibility check. | 5 | The structure is logical: evaluate specific resources and analyze their impact on performance. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete without specifying the network function (e.g., UPF, AMF) or application these resources are intended for. | 4.3 | A clear and well-structured feasibility check that needs more context on the intended application to be fully useful. |
| 14 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Massive_MIMO_64T64R antenna systems with Vertical_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 13Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 5 | All terms used (Massive MIMO 64T64R, Vertical Beamforming, backhaul capacity) are standard and correct within the context of 3GPP 5G NR technology. | 5 | This intent is highly complex, specifying antenna configuration, a specific beamforming technique, and a backhaul capacity target. | 5 | The intent is technically dense but clearly written and easy for a RAN expert or system to understand. | 5 | The verb "Reconfigure" directly indicates a Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent is well-structured: identify system, specify changes, state the goal. | 5 | The specified modifications (beamforming, backhaul) are consistent and complementary actions to improve RAN performance. | 4 | While very detailed, it could be made more complete by specifying the target cell sites or area for this reconfiguration. | 4.9 | An excellent, technically detailed, and actionable modification intent for the Radio Access Network. |
| 15 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 77GB HBM2 memory and 8136GB Optane storage with deterministic performance impact analysis. | 4 | HBM2 and Optane are standard hardware terms. "Deterministic performance" correctly links the evaluation to URLLC-type requirements. | 3 | The intent specifies hardware but lacks the context of the network function or workload to be run. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The description asks to "Evaluate... requirements," which is the definition of a feasibility check. | 5 | The structure is logical: evaluate hardware resources against a specific performance criterion. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent. | 3 | To be actionable, the feasibility check needs to know what software/NF will be running on this hardware. | 4.3 | A well-phrased feasibility check that is missing essential context about the target application. |
| 16 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Establish comprehensive BRONZE_TIER Service Level Agreement with high-priority 99.99% availability guarantee and 99.9% reliability commitment, implementing advanced monitoring and automated remediation capabilities. [Instance-3416-1677]" | 4 | Service tiers (Bronze) and SLAs are standard concepts. Availability and reliability are key KPIs. The values are plausible, although 99.99% availability is high for a "bronze" tier. | 4 | The intent combines SLA definition with implementation details (monitoring, remediation), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and well-structured. | 5 | Defining and enforcing an SLA is a core function of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically connects the SLA definition with the means to enforce it (monitoring, remediation). | 4 | The combination of "BRONZE_TIER" with "high-priority" and a high availability target (99.99%, or "four nines") is slightly inconsistent, as bronze usually implies best-effort or lower guarantees. | 4 | It defines the what (SLA) and how (monitoring), but not the who (which service or slice this applies to). | 4.4 | A good intent for establishing an SLA, though the naming of the tier seems inconsistent with the specified guarantees. |
| 17 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant One_Class_SVM anomaly detection with mission-critical 41% data sampling over 166days retention period. | 4 | The concepts are from data science and operations, not directly from 3GPP specs, but are highly relevant to NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function) operations. One-Class SVM is a valid anomaly detection model. | 5 | Specifies a specific ML model, data sampling rate, and retention period, making it a very detailed and complex analytics request. | 5 | The intent is technically specific but clearly phrased. | 5 | The request to "Compile... insights" is a form of report request. | 5 | The structure is logical, defining the method (model), data parameters (sampling, retention), and goal (insights). | 5 | All technical parameters are consistent with setting up an analytics or machine learning task. | 4 | The intent is missing the context of what data source or which network function's data should be analyzed. | 4.7 | An excellent, technically deep analytics request that aligns well with modern network monitoring practices like NWDAF. |
| 18 | Modification Intent | "Update QoS flow 5QI_84_Intelligent_Transport_Systems configuration with 6082Mbps maximum bitrate optimization, enhancing traffic handling and user experience quality." | 5 | Correctly references a standardized 5G QoS Identifier (5QI) from 3GPP TS 23.501. 5QI 84 is designated for V2X messages. The bitrate is very high but technically possible. | 4 | The intent is specific, targeting a particular QoS flow (by 5QI) and modifying a specific parameter (Maximum Bitrate). | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and suitable for a policy or configuration system. | 5 | The verb "Update" clearly signals a Modification Intent. | 5 | The intent is well-structured: identify the object (QoS flow), the change (bitrate), and the reason (enhance traffic handling). | 5 | Modifying the max bitrate of a QoS flow is a standard and consistent operation. | 5 | The intent is complete for this specific modification task. | 4.9 | An excellent, standards-aligned modification intent that is clear, specific, and actionable. |
| 19 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 20 core utilization and 271GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly identifies the AMF network function and uses standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory). | 4 | A standard but detailed request, specifying the NF, metrics, and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated, unambiguous, and suitable for a reporting or analytics system. | 5 | The action "Generate... report" directly corresponds to the Intent Report Request type. | 5 | The request is well-structured, defining the subject (AMF), the data points (core/memory), and the outcome (recommendations). | 5 | The elements are internally consistent; analyzing resource usage to recommend optimizations is logical. | 5 | Provides all necessary details: the target NF, what to measure, and the expected format of the output. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and technically sound report request that is ready for automated processing. |
| 20 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using fault-tolerant EAP_AKA_Prime authentication and 128_NEA3 encryption with mission-critical 18hours automated key management. [Instance-3420-1707] | 5 | Correctly references 3GPP security mechanisms: EAP-AKA' (TS 33.501) and NEA3 encryption algorithm. The bit-length (128-bit) for NEA3 is incorrect, as NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm. | 4 | Specifies multiple security parameters (authentication, encryption, key management schedule), making it technically detailed. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and easy to parse. | 5 | The goal is to assure performance via a specific security posture, which is a valid use of this intent type. | 5 | The intent logically groups authentication, encryption, and key management as components of a single security policy. | 3 | There is a factual inconsistency. 128_NEA3 is incorrect as NEA3 (also known as AES-256) is a 256-bit algorithm. NEA1 and NEA2 are 128-bit. | 4 | The intent defines a clear security policy but doesn't specify where it should be applied (e.g., to a specific slice or service). | 4.4 | A strong intent that is clear and well-structured, but it contains a significant technical error regarding the encryption algorithm's key length. |
| 21 | Intent Report Request | Compile intelligent analytics insights using fault-tolerant One_Class_SVM anomaly detection with mission-critical 24% data sampling over 87days retention period. | 4 | The terms are from data science and are highly relevant for an NWDAF implementation, though not defined in 3GPP core specifications themselves. | 5 | The intent is technically complex, specifying the ML model, sampling rate, and data retention period. | 5 | The request is clearly phrased and provides specific, machine-readable parameters. | 5 | "Compile... insights" is a clear directive for a report or analytics output. | 5 | The structure is logical and provides all the key parameters needed to configure an analytics job. | 5 | The specified parameters are all consistent with defining a data analytics task. | 4 | Lacks context on what data is being analyzed (e.g., from which NF or for which service). | 4.7 | A technically detailed and well-formed analytics request, ideal for an NWDAF-like function. |
| 22 | Deployment Intent | "Secure high-performance communications using ENABLED SUPI concealment mechanisms and 128_NEA3 encryption protocols, maintaining security without compromising performance characteristics." | 5 | Correctly references SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier) concealment, a key 5G privacy feature from 3GPP TS 33.501. However, 128_NEA3 is incorrect as NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm. | 4 | Combines a privacy feature (SUPI concealment) with an encryption protocol, creating a specific security policy for deployment. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, stating the desired security posture and the performance constraint. | 5 | The description focuses on enabling specific security features, which falls under a deployment or configuration task. | 5 | The structure is logical: enable features (SUPI concealment, encryption) for a stated goal (security without performance loss). | 3 | Contains a factual error: NEA3 is a 256-bit encryption algorithm, not 128-bit. This is a significant inconsistency. | 4 | While it specifies the security mechanisms, it does not specify where to deploy them (e.g., network-wide, for a specific slice). | 4.4 | A good intent focused on security deployment, but the error in the encryption algorithm's bit length is a notable flaw. |
| 23 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 208GB HBM2 memory and 8416GB NVMe_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard high-performance hardware terms relevant for demanding virtualized NFs (like a UPF), but not 3GPP-specific terms. | 3 | Specifies hardware but lacks the context of the network function or workload, which is essential for the evaluation. | 5 | The request is clear, direct, and unambiguous. | 5 | The description asks to "Evaluate... requirements," which is the definition of a feasibility check. | 5 | The structure is logical: evaluate specific resources and analyze their impact on performance. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete without specifying the network function or application these resources are intended for. | 4.3 | A well-phrased feasibility check that is missing essential context about the target application. |
| 24 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 3 core utilization and 139GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Correctly references the AMF network function and uses standard performance metrics (core utilization, memory). | 4 | A standard but detailed request, specifying the NF, metrics, and desired output of the report. | 5 | The intent is clearly stated, unambiguous, and suitable for a reporting or analytics system. | 5 | The action "Generate... report" directly corresponds to the Intent Report Request type. | 5 | The request is well-structured, defining the subject (AMF), the data points (core/memory), and the outcome (recommendations). | 5 | The elements are internally consistent; analyzing resource usage to recommend optimizations is logical. | 5 | Provides all necessary details: the target NF, what to measure, and the expected format of the output. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and technically sound report request that is ready for automated processing. |
| 25 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 551ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. [Instance-3425-1737] | 4 | Uses a general KPI ("response time"). The methods align with ETSI ZSM principles for automation in telco networks. | 3 | Mentions advanced concepts but lacks specificity about the service or context for the response time target. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and easily understandable. | 5 | The description directly states a performance optimization goal, which matches the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: goal (optimize), target metric (551ms response time), and methods (analytics, remediation). | 5 | The methods described are consistent with achieving the stated performance goal. | 3 | Lacks context, such as the specific application, service, or network slice this applies to. | 4.3 | A good, high-level performance intent that needs more specific context to be fully actionable. |
| 26 | Deployment Intent | "Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 2042Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 22.4ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms." | 5 | Correctly uses 3GPP terms: eMBB (enhanced mobile broadband), network slice, throughput, and latency. The values are plausible for an eMBB slice. | 5 | This is a complex intent defining a network slice with specific performance targets for both throughput and latency. | 5 | The intent is clearly written, with specific, measurable targets. | 5 | While it says "Optimize," the context of achieving specific performance targets for a slice is a form of deployment or service creation. | 5 | The structure is logical, specifying the slice type (eMBB), performance goals (throughput, latency), and methods (traffic engineering, QoS). | 5 | The specified parameters (high throughput, low-ish latency) are consistent with the requirements of an eMBB service. | 4 | It would be more complete if it included a slice identifier (e.g., S-NSSAI). | 4.9 | An excellent, detailed, and standards-aligned intent for deploying or configuring a network slice. |
| 27 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA2 security breaches with mission-critical 18hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | References valid security concepts. Certificate-based authentication is used in 5G, and NEA2 is a 128-bit encryption algorithm. "256_NEA2" is incorrect. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security event triggers and a scheduled notification, making it moderately complex. | 4 | The structure is slightly convoluted by mixing reactive alerts with a proactive notification in one sentence. | 5 | The primary action "Alert on" directly aligns with the notification request type. | 4 | The structure could be improved by separating the failure/breach alerts from the key rotation event notification. | 3 | Contains a factual error: NEA2 is a 128-bit algorithm, so "256_NEA2" is incorrect. | 4 | The relationship between the alerts and the key rotation notification is ambiguous. | 4.1 | A good notification intent with relevant technical terms, but it's flawed by a technical inaccuracy and slightly confusing structure. |
| 28 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement autonomous performance optimization using fault-tolerant lstm_with mission-critical_attention_mechanism machine learning models with mission-critical 97.91% prediction accuracy for intelligent network management. | 4 | The ML model name is stylized but LSTM with attention is a real and relevant technique for time-series analysis in networks, aligning with NWDAF concepts. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying a particular type of ML model architecture and a precise prediction accuracy target. | 5 | The intent is technically dense but clearly structured and understandable. | 5 | The goal of implementing an autonomous optimization system based on ML models is a core example of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically links the tool (ML model) with a performance metric (prediction accuracy) and the goal (intelligent management). | 5 | The components are consistent; a high prediction accuracy is required for a reliable autonomous system. | 4 | Lacks context on what the model is predicting (e.g., traffic volume, cell congestion, QoS degradation). | 4.9 | An excellent, technically sophisticated intent that captures the essence of modern, AI-driven network management. |
| 29 | Modification Intent | "Update security configuration using EAP_AKA_Prime authentication methods and 10hours key rotation policies, strengthening security posture and compliance requirements." | 5 | Correctly references EAP-AKA' (TS 33.501), a primary authentication method for 5G. Key rotation is a standard security practice. | 4 | The intent specifies a change to two key security parameters (authentication method, key rotation policy). | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and states both the change and the reason for it. | 5 | The verb "Update" makes it a clear Modification Intent. | 5 | The structure is logical: specify the action (update), the new parameters (EAP-AKA', key rotation), and the goal (strengthen security). | 5 | The specified changes are consistent and work together to enhance the security posture. | 4 | It would be more complete if it specified where this security configuration should be applied (e.g., which NFs or services). | 4.7 | A strong, clear, and standards-aligned intent for modifying a security policy. |
| 30 | Deployment Intent | "Execute mission-critical massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems deployment with Non_Standalone_5G network architecture and Traditional_MIMO_4T4R MIMO antenna systems, ensuring ultra-reliable massive connectivity for critical applications." | 4 | Uses 3GPP terms like mMTC, NSA, and MIMO. However, there's a contradiction between "massive" connectivity (mMTC) and "ultra-reliable" (URLLC), which have conflicting requirements. | 5 | The intent is complex, specifying the service type (mMTC), network architecture (NSA), and a specific RAN technology (MIMO). | 5 | The intent is well-written and easy to understand, despite the technical terms. | 5 | The request to "Execute deployment" aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, defining the what (mMTC service), how (NSA, MIMO), and why (ultra-reliable massive connectivity). | 2 | There is a significant inconsistency between the goals of "massive" connectivity (many low-power devices) and "ultra-reliable" connectivity (guaranteed low-latency for critical apps). They are typically separate service types. | 4 | The intent is quite descriptive but could specify the target deployment region. | 4.3 | A well-structured deployment intent that is unfortunately weakened by a fundamental inconsistency in combining mMTC and URLLC characteristics. |
| 31 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 74 RISC_V processing cores at 3.26GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | Correctly references a 3GPP NF (AMF) and relevant constraints ("deterministic performance" for URLLC).

This aligns with the analytics capabilities of the 3GPP NWDAF. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent, specifying an ML model architecture and a precise prediction accuracy target. | 5 | The intent is technically dense but clearly structured and understandable. | 5 | The goal of implementing an autonomous optimization system is a core example of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically links the tool (ML model) with a performance metric (prediction accuracy) and the goal (intelligent management). | 5 | The components are consistent; a high prediction accuracy is required for a reliable autonomous system. | 4 | Lacks context on what the model is predicting (e.g., network load, quality of experience). | 4.9 | An excellent, technically sophisticated intent that captures the essence of modern, AI-driven network management. |
| 36 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Monitor network performance using One_Class_SVM behavioral anomaly detection with Random_Forest predictive analytics capabilities, enabling proactive performance management. [Instance-3436-1796]" | 4 | The ML models mentioned (One-Class SVM, Random Forest) are standard data science techniques highly applicable to network analytics (e.g., in NWDAF). | 4 | The intent specifies two different machine learning models for different tasks (anomaly detection, prediction), making it moderately complex. | 5 | The intent is clearly written and describes a coherent monitoring strategy. | 5 | The description focuses on monitoring and proactive management, which are key aspects of performance assurance. | 5 | The intent logically combines anomaly detection with predictive analytics to achieve the goal of proactive management. | 5 | The use of both anomaly detection and predictive models is a consistent and common strategy in advanced monitoring systems. | 4 | The intent is general ("network performance").

| 37 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with 14hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | References valid security concepts. Certificate-based authentication is used in 5G. However, 128_NEA3 is incorrect as NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm. | 4 | The intent combines multiple security event triggers and a scheduled notification. | 4 | The structure is slightly convoluted by mixing reactive alerts with a proactive notification in one sentence. | 5 | The primary action "Alert on" directly aligns with the notification request type. | 4 | The structure could be improved by separating the failure/breach alerts from the key rotation event notification. | 3 | Contains a factual error: NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm, so "128_NEA3" is incorrect. | 4 | The relationship between the alerts and the key rotation notification is ambiguous. | 4.1 | A good notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by a technical inaccuracy in the encryption algorithm name. |
| 38 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 171GB DDR5 memory and 2302GB SATA_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | Uses standard hardware terms. "Mission-critical performance" correctly links the evaluation to URLLC-type requirements. | 3 | Specifies hardware but lacks the context of the network function or workload to be run. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and easy to understand. | 5 | The description asks to "Evaluate... requirements," which is the definition of a feasibility check. | 5 | The structure is logical: evaluate hardware resources against a specific performance criterion. | 5 | The components of the request are internally consistent. | 3 | To be actionable, the feasibility check needs to know what software/NF will be running on this hardware. | 4.3 | A well-phrased feasibility check that is missing essential context about the target application. |
| 39 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | Correctly references 3GPP security mechanisms: 5G AKA authentication and NEA1 (128-bit) encryption algorithm, both from TS 33.501. | 4 | The intent combines multiple triggers (authentication failure, breach) and a separate event notification (key rotation). | 4 | The phrasing is a bit convoluted, mixing reactive alerts with a proactive notification in a single sentence. | 5 | The request to "Alert on" specific events clearly aligns with a notification request. | 4 | The intent structure is a bit disjointed, mixing reactive alerts (failures, breaches) with a proactive notification (key rotation). | 5 | The specified security mechanisms and events are all consistent within the domain of network security. | 4 | It's unclear if the key rotation is a trigger or just another event to be notified about. Clarifying the relationship would improve it. | 4.4 | A good notification intent with correct technical terms, but its structure could be clearer. |

| 44 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 118 processing cores and 463GB memory allocation with mission-critical transport network optimization. | 4 | Uses standard terms like "core network" and "transport network". The resource values are specific. | 3 | The intent is vague. It links core compute resources to transport network optimization without specifying the relationship or the target NF. | 3 | The phrasing is ambiguous. It's unclear how modifying core processing/memory directly optimizes the transport network without further details. | 5 | The verb "Modify" aligns with the intent type. | 2 | The coherence is low. A direct causal link between adjusting compute on an unspecified NF and "transport network optimization" is not clearly established. | 3 | The intent seems inconsistent. It modifies compute resources but states the goal in terms of the transport network, which is usually managed separately. | 2 | The intent is highly incomplete. It doesn't specify which NF to modify, what the transport optimization entails, or what metrics define success. | 3.1 | A poorly formed intent that is ambiguous, incoherent, and lacks the necessary details to be actionable. |

To be complete for deployment, it would need to specify where this policy is applied (e.g., between which domains or NFs). | 4.4 | A good, technically specific security deployment intent, with a slightly unusual combination of key and hash function sizes. |
| 57 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 152ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.009132 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Correctly uses 3GPP QoS parameters: Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Rate (PER).

| 58 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using fault-tolerant Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 128_NEA3 encryption protocols with mission-criticalout compromising performance characteristics. | 5 | References valid 3GPP security concepts like certificate-based authentication. However, "128_NEA3" is incorrect as NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm. The typo "mission-criticalout" harms readability. | 4 | Specifies both authentication and encryption mechanisms, giving it good technical detail. | 3 | The sentence is broken by a typo ("mission-criticalout compromising") which makes it grammatically incorrect and harder to parse. | 5 | The intent is to "secure" the infrastructure to assure performance, which is a valid interpretation of this intent type. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical but is disrupted by the typo. | 3 | There is a factual inconsistency: NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm, not 128-bit. | 4 | The intent defines a security policy but doesn't specify where it should be applied. | 4.0 | A good intent with correct concepts, but it is significantly weakened by a technical error and a disruptive typo. |

| 61 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 114Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with mission-critical 68.24ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 4 | Uses standard performance metrics (bitrate, latency). "Ultra-low latency" is a key 5G concept, though 68.24ms is not typically considered "ultra-low" (which is often <10ms). | 4 | The feasibility check requires a complex analysis considering multiple factors (bitrate, latency, topology, traffic). | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and specifies the parameters and context for the analysis. | 5 | The request to "Analyze... feasibility" is a clear match for the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: check feasibility of performance targets (bitrate, latency) given certain conditions (topology, traffic). | 4 | Calling 68.24ms "ultra-low latency" is a slight inconsistency in terminology, as URLLC targets are much lower. However, it's a valid latency constraint. | 4 | To be more complete, it could specify the area or type of service for which this analysis is being performed. | 4.4 | A good, well-structured feasibility check, with a minor terminological inconsistency regarding "ultra-low latency." |
| 62 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 22hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | Correctly references 5G AKA. However, 128_NEA3 is incorrect as NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm. | 4 | Combines multiple security event triggers with a scheduled notification. | 4 | The structure is slightly convoluted, mixing reactive alerts with a proactive notification in a single sentence. | 5 | The primary action "Alert on" directly aligns with the notification request type. | 4 | The structure could be improved by separating the failure/breach alerts from the key rotation event notification. | 3 | Contains a factual error: NEA3 is a 256-bit algorithm, so "128_NEA3" is incorrect. | 4 | The relationship between the alerts and the key rotation notification is ambiguous. | 4.1 | A good notification intent that is unfortunately flawed by a technical inaccuracy in the encryption algorithm name. |

| 64 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 283ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | Uses a general KPI ("response time"). The methods align with ETSI ZSM principles for automation in telco networks. | 3 | Mentions advanced concepts but lacks specificity about the service or context for the response time target. | 5 | The language is clear, concise, and easily understandable. | 5 | The description directly states a performance optimization goal, which matches the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: goal (optimize), target metric (283ms response time), and methods (analytics, remediation). | 5 | The methods described are consistent with achieving the stated performance goal. | 3 | Lacks context, such as the specific application, service, or network slice this applies to. | 4.3 | A good, high-level performance intent that needs more specific context to be fully actionable. |
