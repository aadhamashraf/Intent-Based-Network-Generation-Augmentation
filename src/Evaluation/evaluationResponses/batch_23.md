|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 102 RISC_V processing cores at 3.26GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G Core function (3GPP TS 23.501). The check for deterministic performance on a specific hardware architecture (RISC-V) is a valid and forward-looking feasibility study. | 5 | The intent specifies a core network function, a non-traditional CPU architecture (RISC-V), specific hardware parameters (cores, clock speed), and high-level performance constraints. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and uses precise technical terminology. | 5 | The description is a direct and clear request for a feasibility check, perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, starting with the goal, specifying the components, and ending with the constraints. | 5 | The components of the intent are logically connected and do not contradict each other. Assessing a 5G function on new hardware is a consistent goal. | 4 | The intent provides sufficient detail (NF, hardware, constraints) for a high-level feasibility assessment. | 4.9 | A high-quality, clear, and technically specific intent that is highly relevant for modern network planning. |
| 2 | Regular Notification Request | Configure intelligent massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems monitoring with high-priority Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection and proactive alerting for performance degradation. [Instance-4402-7465] | 5 | The use of mMTC (massive machine-type communications) is a standard 5G service category (TS 23.501). Employing AI/ML (Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection aligns with the principles of NWDAF (TS 23.288). | 5 | This intent combines a 5G service category (mMTC), a specific AI/ML model, a monitoring goal, a priority level, and a notification trigger, making it highly detailed. | 4 | The sentence is grammatically correct but slightly long. However, it is unambiguous for a technical audience. | 5 | The description directly requests a notification configuration, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically flows from the high-level context (mMTC) to the specific mechanism (Isolation Forest) and desired outcome (alerting). | 5 | The use of anomaly detection to monitor performance in an IoT/mMTC environment is a consistent and practical use case. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the context, method, trigger, and action for the notification. | 4.9 | An excellent, well-defined intent for proactive network assurance using modern AI/ML techniques. |
| 3 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy intelligent edge ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency communications for mission-critical applications infrastructure with DISTRIBUTED deployment strategy supporting 458392_devices_per_km2 device connectivity density, enabling ultra-low ultra-low latency applications and local data processing." | 3 | URLLC and edge deployment are standard 3GPP concepts. However, the term "ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency" is non-standard and redundant. The specified device density is more typical of mMTC. | 5 | It specifies slice type (URLLC), architecture (edge, distributed), and multiple, demanding KPIs (latency, density), making it a complex deployment scenario. | 2 | The repetitive and awkward phrasing "ultra-ultra-reliable low-ultra-low latency" significantly hinders readability. | 5 | The description clearly outlines a deployment goal, which is relevant to the "Deployment Intent" type. | 3 | The core request is coherent, but the redundant phrasing makes the structure awkward and unprofessional. | 3 | The intent combines a URLLC primary requirement with an extremely high device density typical of mMTC, creating a potentially contradictory set of performance goals. | 4 | The intent specifies what to deploy, where, how, and for what purpose, providing a good level of detail. | 3.6 | A relevant but poorly phrased intent with potentially conflicting performance requirements that would need clarification. |
| 4 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade PCF network function using fault-tolerant Ericsson SW_3.1.50 software on high-performance 6-core x86_64 architecture with mission-critical 31GB DDR5 memory and 680GB SATA_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | PCF is a standard 5G NF (TS 23.501). The specification of hardware (x86_64, DDR5, SATA SSD) and software are all standard and correct for a VNF/CNF deployment. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, detailing the NF, vendor, software version, hardware architecture, CPU, memory, and storage requirements. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easy for both humans and automation systems to parse. | 5 | This is a clear and direct request to deploy a specific network function, matching the intent type. | 5 | The description flows logically, detailing the different components of the deployment in a structured manner. | 4 | All parameters are consistent. The use of SATA SSD for a "high-performance" function is slightly questionable compared to NVMe but is not a direct contradiction. | 5 | The intent provides a comprehensive and actionable set of parameters needed for a VNF/CNF deployment. | 4.9 | An exemplary deployment intent that is specific, actionable, and aligns well with industry practices. |
| 5 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate PCF deployment through nfvo_35db28f416d8 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_9082e487d825 VNF Manager integration. | 5 | The intent correctly references the key components of the ETSI NFV MANO architecture (NFVO, VNFM) for orchestrating a Network Function (PCF). | 3 | The intent is specific to the orchestration plane but lacks details about the PCF service or resource requirements itself. | 5 | The language is direct, clear, and uses standard acronyms correctly, making it highly readable. | 5 | The intent describes a deployment action focused on orchestration, which is a valid type of deployment intent. | 5 | The intent presents a clear, logical instruction for the orchestration and management system. | 5 | The roles of NFVO and VNFM in coordinating a deployment are described correctly and consistently. | 3 | The intent is complete for its specific scope (coordination) but lacks details about the NF being deployed. | 4.4 | A good, clear intent focused on the management and orchestration aspect of a deployment. |
| 6 | Regular Notification Request | Alert using fault-tolerant Simulated_Annealing intelligent insights with mission-critical 91days historical analysis for trend-based notifications. | 4 | While using ML/AI for insights is aligned with NWDAF principles, Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm, not typically used for generating "insights" or trend analysis directly. A different model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) would be more appropriate. | 4 | The intent combines a specific (though slightly misplaced) algorithm, a data analysis period, and a notification type, making it moderately complex. | 4 | The intent is grammatically correct and reasonably clear, although the use of "Simulated_Annealing" in this context is slightly confusing. | 5 | The description clearly asks for an alert/notification, matching the intent type. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the choice of algorithm slightly weakens the coherence of the technical request. | 3 | Using an optimization algorithm like Simulated Annealing for trend-based notifications from historical data is an inconsistent application of the technique. | 4 | The intent specifies the trigger source (insights), method (algorithm), data scope (91 days), and notification type (trend-based). | 4.0 | A mostly well-formed intent, but its technical correctness is slightly undermined by an unconventional choice of algorithm for the stated purpose. |
| 7 | Modification Intent | "Update security configuration using fault-tolerant 5G_AKA authentication methods and 6hours key rotation policies, strengthening security posture and compliance requirements." | 5 | 5G-AKA is the primary authentication method for 5G, as defined in 3GPP TS 33.501. Key rotation policies are a standard security practice. | 4 | The intent specifies the security components to be updated (authentication, key rotation) and the parameters, which is reasonably complex. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and directly states the desired change and its purpose. | 5 | The description is a direct request to modify an existing configuration, which perfectly matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically connects the specific actions (update auth, set key rotation) to the high-level goal (strengthening security). | 5 | The use of 5G-AKA and key rotation policies are standard, consistent security measures in a 5G network. | 4 | The intent provides the necessary information for the security configuration update. | 4.7 | An excellent, clear, and standards-aligned intent for modifying network security policies. |
| 8 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 127 processing cores and 234GB memory allocation with mission-critical 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The modification of compute resources (cores, memory) and performance constraints (timeout) is a standard operation in a virtualized environment (NFV/cloud). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple resource parameters (cores, memory, timeout), making it a detailed modification request. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated with specific values, making it easy to parse and act upon. | 5 | The description clearly defines a modification to existing resources, aligning with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links the resource adjustment to the goal of optimizing performance and cost. | 5 | The specified parameters (cores, memory, timeout) are independent and consistent with each other. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary parameters (cores, memory, timeout) for the resource adjustment. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and actionable intent for resource modification in a cloud-native environment. |
| 9 | Deployment Intent | "Launch critical priority network service guaranteeing 1666Mbps guaranteed bitrate with mission-critical strict 13.61ms packet delay budget, supporting mission-critical applications with mission-critical deterministic performance characteristics." | 5 | The use of guaranteed bitrate and packet delay budget are standard QoS parameters (5QI in 3GPP TS 23.501) for defining a network service or slice. | 4 | The intent specifies service priority, a high guaranteed bitrate, and a strict latency budget, which defines a demanding and complex service. | 4 | The intent is mostly readable, though the repeated use of "mission-critical" is slightly redundant. | 5 | The description outlines the deployment of a new network service, which matches the intent type. | 5 | The intent presents a clear goal (launch service) with specific, logical performance characteristics. | 5 | The requirements for high guaranteed bitrate and low, deterministic latency are consistent with a mission-critical service like URLLC. | 5 | The intent provides the key performance indicators (bitrate, delay) needed to define the service level. | 4.7 | A strong, well-defined intent for deploying a high-performance network slice or service. |
| 10 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 87 ARM64 processing cores at 2.03GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G Core NF. ARM64 is a common architecture in modern data centers and edge deployments. The constraints are relevant for 5G services. | 5 | The intent specifies the NF, a specific CPU architecture, core count, clock speed, and the criteria for the feasibility study. | 5 | The request is clear, concise, and uses precise technical language. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a feasibility check, perfectly matching the intent type. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured and logical. | 5 | The components are all logically connected and plausible for a network function deployment study. | 4 | The intent provides enough specific information for a high-level feasibility assessment. | 4.9 | Another high-quality feasibility check intent, demonstrating a clear understanding of network planning requirements. |
| 11 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 128_NEA2 security breaches with 9hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication and 128-NEA2 encryption are valid 3GPP security mechanisms. However, bundling authentication failures, security breaches, and key rotation events into a single alert description is slightly incoherent. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple, distinct security event triggers for a single notification rule. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the connection between the different triggers ("failures or breaches with key rotation") is ambiguous. | 5 | The description is a request for an alert, which matches the intent type. | 3 | The logic is slightly disjointed. It's unclear if key rotation is a trigger itself or just context for the other triggers. A clearer structure would be "Alert on X, alert on Y, and notify on Z". | 4 | The security mechanisms themselves are consistent, but their combination in a single alerting rule is slightly unusual. | 4 | It specifies the events to monitor and requests notification, but the relationship between the events is not perfectly clear. | 4.0 | A good intent that specifies valid security events to monitor, but could be structured more clearly to avoid ambiguity. |
| 12 | Modification Intent | "Update artificial intelligence models to lstm_with_attention_mechanism achieving 98.78% prediction accuracy with multi_objective_genetic_algorithm optimization algorithms, enhancing intelligent network operations." | 5 | The use of AI/ML models like LSTM for network operations is a key concept in 3GPP's NWDAF. Using genetic algorithms for optimization is a valid MLOps practice. | 5 | The intent is highly complex, specifying a particular ML model architecture, a target performance metric (accuracy), and the optimization method to be used. | 5 | The intent is very clear and uses specific, correct terminology from the AI/ML domain. | 5 | This is a clear request to modify an existing system component (the AI model), matching the intent type. | 5 | The intent flows logically from the action (update model) to the desired outcome (accuracy) and the method (optimization). | 5 | The specified components (LSTM with attention, genetic algorithm for optimization) are consistent and represent a sophisticated and plausible MLOps task. | 5 | It provides a complete picture of the desired modification: the new model, its target performance, and the optimization technique. | 5.0 | An outstanding, technically deep, and precise intent representing an advanced stage of network automation. |
| 13 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 326GB HBM2 memory and 8640GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 4 | HBM2 and NVMe PCIe4 are very high-performance memory and storage technologies. While technically plausible, evaluating requirements *for* a given amount of hardware is a slightly backward way to phrase the request. It should be "Evaluate requirements and assess feasibility *using* X hardware". | 4 | The intent specifies advanced hardware types and requires a performance impact analysis, making it complex. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly awkward ("requirements for 326GB HBM2 memory") but the intent is understandable. | 5 | The description is a request for an evaluation/check, which aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, despite the slightly backward phrasing of the core request. | 5 | The combination of high-performance memory (HBM2) and storage (NVMe) is consistent for a demanding application. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function or service the hardware is for. | 4.1 | A good intent that specifies relevant high-performance hardware, but it lacks context about the workload, making the feasibility check difficult. |
| 14 | Deployment Intent | "Execute research-grade sophisticated with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated AI integration vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation network slice deployment featuring Massive_MIMO_64T64R antenna systems with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated 3D_Beamforming beamforming capabilities across 700MHz/3.5GHz/28GHz spectrum bands, optimized for Urban_Micro coverage scenarios." | 5 | All the technical components—V2X, network slicing, Massive MIMO, 3D Beamforming, and the specified frequency bands—are valid and standard 5G concepts. | 5 | This is an extremely complex intent, combining V2X, AI, slicing, advanced RAN features (MIMO, beamforming), multi-band spectrum, and a coverage scenario. | 1 | The intent is nearly unreadable due to the excessive and awkwardly placed repetition of adjectives like "research-grade sophisticated" and "mission-critical". | 5 | Despite the poor phrasing, the core request is to deploy a network slice, which matches the intent type. | 1 | The sentence structure is broken and incoherent due to the repetitive, non-technical adjectives. | 5 | The technical parameters themselves are consistent: Massive MIMO on mid-band, multi-band strategy for coverage and capacity, and 3D beamforming are all synergistic. | 5 | The intent is extremely detailed, providing a complete technical specification for the slice deployment. | 4.0 | A technically rich and complete intent that is severely compromised by extremely poor readability and coherence, making it unusable for automation without significant pre-processing. |
| 15 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with mission-critical automated escalation. [Instance-4415-7521] | 5 | Monitoring throughput and latency are fundamental aspects of Service Level Agreement (SLA) assurance, fully aligned with 3GPP OAM principles. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct performance KPIs (throughput, latency) and an action (escalation), making it a comprehensive notification rule. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and uses standard performance metrics, making it perfectly readable. | 5 | The description is a clear request for an alert, matching the intent type. | 5 | The logic is clear: IF (performance metric A or B is breached) THEN (escalate). | 5 | The KPIs of high throughput and low latency are often monitored together for high-performance services, making the request consistent. | 5 | The intent completely defines the notification trigger (KPIs and thresholds) and the action (automated escalation). | 4.9 | An excellent, practical, and well-formed intent for performance monitoring and assurance. |
| 16 | Intent Report Request | Evaluate service availability metrics reporting 99.99% availability achievement and 99.9% reliability performance with high-priority trend analysis and predictive insights. [Instance-4416-7539] | 5 | Availability and reliability are standard KPIs for network services. Trend analysis and predictive insights are aligned with advanced assurance and NWDAF concepts. | 4 | The request is for a report on multiple complex metrics, including predictive analysis, which adds to its complexity. | 5 | The language is clear and professional, specifying the desired metrics and analysis types. | 5 | The description is a request for an evaluation and report, which aligns perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically progresses from the core metrics (availability, reliability) to the desired analysis (trends, predictions). | 5 | The requested metrics and analysis types are consistent and commonly used in service performance management. | 5 | The intent clearly specifies the metrics to report on, the target values, and the type of analysis required. | 4.9 | An excellent intent for service performance reporting, incorporating both retrospective and predictive analysis. |
| 17 | Deployment Intent | Coordinate UPF deployment through nfvo_faa15cfac4c6 Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator and vnfm_2f6778582ce0 VNF Manager integration. | 5 | UPF is a standard 5G core function. The use of NFVO and VNFM aligns perfectly with the ETSI NFV MANO architecture. | 3 | Similar to record 5, this intent is specific to the orchestration plane but lacks details about the UPF itself (e.g., capacity, features). | 5 | The intent is direct, clear, and uses standard acronyms correctly. | 5 | This is a deployment action focused on orchestration, matching the intent type. | 5 | The intent presents a clear, logical instruction for the management system. | 5 | The roles of NFVO and VNFM in coordinating a UPF deployment are correct and consistent. | 3 | The intent is complete for its specific scope (coordination) but lacks details about the NF being deployed. | 4.4 | A good, clear intent focused on the management and orchestration aspect of deploying a UPF. |
| 18 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 956ms response time with high-priority predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | A 956ms response time is very high and would not be considered "optimized performance" for most real-time services. The other concepts (predictive analytics, remediation) are valid. | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI, a priority, and the methods to be used (predictive analytics, automated remediation), making it complex. | 4 | The intent is clearly phrased, but the target response time is unusually high for a performance optimization goal. | 5 | The description outlines a goal for performance assurance and optimization, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: achieve KPI target using specified advanced methods. | 2 | The stated goal of "optimizing performance" is inconsistent with the very high target response time of 956ms. This value seems unrealistic or erroneous. | 4 | The intent specifies the target metric, the value, and the methods, but the context is missing (what service is this for?). | 4.0 | A well-structured intent whose credibility is undermined by an inconsistent and unrealistic performance target. |
| 19 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure performance assurance using fault-tolerant EAP_TLS authentication and 128_NEA2 encryption with mission-critical 15hours automated key management. [Instance-4419-7570] | 4 | EAP-TLS and 128-NEA2 are standard security mechanisms (3GPP TS 33.501). The intent describes securing the system, which is an aspect of assurance, but it focuses exclusively on security parameters rather than performance KPIs like latency or throughput. | 4 | It specifies authentication and encryption algorithms, along with a key management policy. | 4 | The phrase "Secure performance assurance" is slightly awkward. A "Security Configuration Intent" might have been a better fit. | 4 | The description is about security configuration, which is related to but not the core of "performance assurance." The relevance is moderate. | 5 | The specified security components are logically related. | 5 | The use of EAP-TLS, 128-NEA2, and automated key management are all consistent and standard security practices. | 4 | The intent specifies the security parameters clearly. | 4.3 | A good, clear security-focused intent that is slightly miscategorized as a "Performance Assurance Intent." |
| 20 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with 19hours key rotation event notifications. [Instance-4420-7589] | 4 | 5G-AKA is a standard authentication method. 256-NEA1 is not a standard 3GPP algorithm; the standards define NEA0, NEA1 (128-bit), NEA2 (128-bit), and NEA3 (128-bit). 256-bit algorithms are specified for SUCI encryption but not for user plane encryption with this naming. The bundling of triggers is also slightly ambiguous. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple security triggers for a notification rule. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the connection between authentication/breach alerts and "key rotation event notifications" is unclear. | 5 | The description requests an alert, matching the intent type. | 3 | The logic is disjointed. It's unclear if key rotation is a third trigger or just contextual information. | 3 | The reference to "256_NEA1" appears to be non-standard, which is a significant consistency issue. | 4 | It specifies the events to monitor, but the ambiguous structure and non-standard term are problematic. | 3.9 | An intent with valid concepts but flawed by a non-standard technical term and an ambiguous logical structure. |
| 21 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade AUSF network function using fault-tolerant Ericsson SW_1.3.909 software on high-performance 3-core x86_64 architecture with mission-critical 22GB DDR5 memory and 185GB NVMe_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | AUSF is a standard 5G NF (TS 33.501, TS 23.501). The hardware and software specifications are all standard and plausible for a VNF/CNF deployment. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, detailing the NF, vendor, software version, hardware architecture, CPU, memory, and storage requirements. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easy for both humans and automation systems to parse. | 5 | This is a clear and direct request to deploy a specific network function, matching the intent type. | 5 | The description flows logically, detailing the different components of the deployment in a structured manner. | 5 | The specified resources (3-core, 22GB RAM, NVMe SSD) are reasonable and consistent for an AUSF instance. | 5 | The intent provides a comprehensive and actionable set of parameters needed for a VNF/CNF deployment. | 5.0 | An exemplary deployment intent that is specific, actionable, and aligns perfectly with industry practices. |
| 22 | Regular Notification Request | Alert when 1000Mbps high-throughput performance drops below thresholds or 5ms latency exceeds acceptable limits with automated escalation. [Instance-4422-7612] | 5 | Monitoring throughput and latency are fundamental aspects of Service Level Agreement (SLA) assurance, fully aligned with 3GPP OAM principles. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct performance KPIs (throughput, latency) and an action (escalation), making it a comprehensive notification rule. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and uses standard performance metrics, making it perfectly readable. | 5 | The description is a clear request for an alert, matching the intent type. | 5 | The logic is clear: IF (performance metric A or B is breached) THEN (escalate). | 5 | The KPIs of high throughput and low latency are often monitored together for high-performance services, making the request consistent. | 5 | The intent completely defines the notification trigger (KPIs and thresholds) and the action (automated escalation). | 4.9 | An excellent, practical, and well-formed intent for performance monitoring and assurance. This is a duplicate of a previous intent but is valid on its own. |
| 23 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 78GB HBM2 memory and 2252GB SATA_SSD storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | HBM2 is high-performance memory, while SATA SSD is a lower-performance storage technology. The combination is slightly unusual. The phrasing "requirements for" is also slightly backward. | 4 | The intent specifies advanced memory and storage types and requires a performance impact analysis. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly awkward ("requirements for 78GB HBM2 memory") but the core request is understandable. | 5 | The description is a request for an evaluation/check, which aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, despite the slightly awkward phrasing. | 3 | The pairing of very high-speed HBM2 memory with slower SATA SSD storage is an inconsistent choice for a performance-oriented system. NVMe would be more logical. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function or service the hardware is for. | 3.9 | A moderately well-formed intent that is weakened by a lack of workload context and an inconsistent hardware specification. |
| 24 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with mission-critical Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 74Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 4 | 4T4R MIMO and beamforming are standard RAN concepts. However, "Horizontal_Beamforming" is not a standard term; beamforming is typically described as 2D or 3D. The 74Gbps backhaul capacity is extremely high and may be inconsistent with a "Traditional_MIMO_4T4R" system. | 4 | The intent combines modifications to the antenna system, beamforming technique, and backhaul capacity. | 4 | The intent is mostly readable, but the term "Horizontal_Beamforming" is non-standard and could cause confusion. | 5 | The description is a clear request to reconfigure network elements, matching the intent type. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the non-standard terminology slightly impairs coherence. | 2 | The massive 74Gbps backhaul capacity seems inconsistent with a relatively simple 4T4R antenna system. This level of backhaul would typically support much more advanced Massive MIMO arrays. The beamforming term is also non-standard. | 4 | The intent specifies what to reconfigure and what the desired enhancements are. | 3.9 | An intent with a clear goal that suffers from non-standard terminology and a significant inconsistency between the antenna system and backhaul capacity. |
| 25 | Deployment Intent | "Deploy enterprise-grade PCF network function using Nokia SW_1.8.539 software on high-performance 3-core ARM64 architecture with 14GB DDR5 memory and 53GB SATA_SSD storage, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability." | 5 | PCF is a standard 5G NF. The specification of vendor, software, and hardware (ARM64, DDR5) are all standard and plausible for a CNF deployment. | 5 | The intent is highly specific, detailing the NF, vendor, software version, hardware architecture, CPU, memory, and storage requirements. | 5 | The sentence is well-structured, clear, and easy for both humans and automation systems to parse. | 5 | This is a clear and direct request to deploy a specific network function, matching the intent type. | 5 | The description flows logically, detailing the different components of the deployment in a structured manner. | 5 | The specified resources (3-core, 14GB RAM) are reasonable and consistent for a PCF instance. | 5 | The intent provides a comprehensive and actionable set of parameters needed for a VNF/CNF deployment. | 5.0 | An exemplary deployment intent that is specific, actionable, and aligns perfectly with industry practices. |
| 26 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 31 core utilization and 364GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific NF (AMF) focusing on CPU and memory utilization is a standard and crucial OAM task. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF, the exact metrics to analyze, and asks for recommendations, making it a detailed reporting request. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and uses standard terminology. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a report, aligning perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: generate a report on specific metrics for a specific NF and include recommendations. | 5 | The request to analyze core and memory usage for an AMF is a perfectly consistent and valid operational requirement. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and practical intent for network function performance analysis and optimization. |
| 27 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 17 processing cores and 476GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing deterministic performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The modification of compute resources (cores, memory) and performance constraints (timeout) is a standard operation in a virtualized environment. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple resource parameters (cores, memory, timeout), making it a detailed modification request. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated with specific values, making it easy to parse and act upon. | 5 | The description clearly defines a modification to existing resources, aligning with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links the resource adjustment to the goal of optimizing deterministic performance and cost. | 5 | The specified parameters are independent and consistent with each other for a resource scaling operation. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary parameters (cores, memory, timeout) for the resource adjustment. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and actionable intent for resource modification, similar to a previous valid record. |

| 31 | Deployment Intent | Optimize cloud-native performance achieving 9756Mbps high-throughput targets and 30.1ms latency requirements through intelligent resource allocation and traffic optimization. | 5 | The KPIs (throughput, latency) and methods (resource allocation, traffic optimization) are all standard concepts in managing cloud-native network functions. | 4 | The intent specifies target KPIs and high-level methods for optimization, but not a specific NF or service. | 5 | The language is clear and uses standard performance engineering terms. | 4 | This is more of a high-level goal or policy intent rather than a specific deployment intent. It describes an optimization objective for an existing deployment. | 5 | The intent clearly states the goal (optimize performance) and the means to achieve it. | 5 | High throughput and low latency are consistent performance goals for many 5G services like eMBB. | 4 | The intent provides clear targets but lacks the context of which application or service is being optimized. | 4.6 | A well-formed intent that functions more as a high-level performance policy or optimization goal than a discrete deployment task. |
| 32 | Deployment Intent | "Execute research-grade sophisticated with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated AI integration vehicle-to-everything connectivity enabling autonomous transportation network slice deployment featuring Massive_MIMO_32T32R antenna systems with mission-critical research-grade sophisticated 3D_Beamforming beamforming capabilities across 800MHz/3.5GHz/28GHz spectrum bands, optimized for Urban_Macro coverage scenarios." | 5 | All technical elements—V2X, slicing, 32T32R Massive MIMO, 3D Beamforming, multi-band spectrum, and Urban_Macro scenario—are correct and standard 5G concepts. | 5 | This is a highly complex intent combining V2X, AI, slicing, advanced RAN features, multi-band spectrum, and a coverage scenario. | 1 | The intent is nearly unreadable due to the excessive and awkwardly placed repetition of adjectives like "research-grade sophisticated" and "mission-critical". | 5 | Despite the severe readability issues, the core request is to deploy a network slice, matching the intent type. | 1 | The sentence structure is broken and incoherent due to the repetitive, meaningless adjectives. | 5 | The technical parameters are consistent. A multi-band strategy with Massive MIMO for an Urban Macro V2X slice is a plausible and synergistic combination. | 5 | The intent provides a complete and detailed technical specification for the slice deployment. | 4.0 | A technically rich and complete intent that is severely compromised by extremely poor readability and coherence, making it unusable for automation without significant pre-processing. |
| 33 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 23hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based authentication is valid. As noted before, "256_NEA1" is not a standard 3GPP encryption algorithm name. The bundling of multiple, distinct triggers is also slightly ambiguous. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple security triggers and a priority for a notification rule. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the connection between authentication/breach alerts and "key rotation event notifications" is unclear. | 5 | The description requests an alert, matching the intent type. | 3 | The logic is disjointed. It's unclear if key rotation is a third trigger or just contextual information. | 3 | The reference to "256_NEA1" appears to be non-standard, which is a significant consistency issue. | 4 | It specifies the events to monitor, but the ambiguous structure and non-standard term are problematic. | 3.9 | An intent with valid concepts but flawed by a non-standard technical term and an ambiguous logical structure. |
| 34 | Deployment Intent | "Optimize enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput data services network slice performance achieving 5716Mbps maximum high-throughput with stringent 12.9ms latency constraints, utilizing advanced traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms." | 5 | eMBB, network slicing, throughput, latency, traffic engineering, and QoS are all standard 3GPP and networking concepts. | 4 | The intent specifies the slice type, target KPIs, and high-level optimization mechanisms. | 4 | The intent is clear, but contains minor redundancy ("enhanced mobile broadband with high-high-throughput"). | 4 | This is better described as a performance optimization intent for an existing slice rather than a new deployment. | 5 | The intent clearly states the goal (optimize slice), the target metrics, and the methods. | 5 | The KPIs of very high throughput and low latency are consistent with the goals of an eMBB network slice. | 5 | The intent provides clear performance targets and the general methods to be used. | 4.6 | A well-formed intent that acts as a performance policy for an eMBB slice. |
| 35 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 90 RISC_V processing cores at 1.51GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G Core NF.

| 37 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 263ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.006402 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 4 | A 263ms packet delay budget is extremely high for any real-time or critical service. Standard 5QI values are typically much lower (e.g., 5-300ms, but 263 is on the very high, non-interactive end). The error rate is a valid parameter. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct QoS parameters (delay, error rate) for configuration. | 4 | The intent is clearly phrased, but the target delay budget is unusually high for a "mission-critical" service. | 5 | The description is a configuration request aimed at assuring performance, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: configure parameter A and parameter B using specified mechanisms. | 2 | The stated delay budget of 263ms is inconsistent with the "mission-critical" qualifier, which implies much lower latency. | 4 | The intent provides the specific QoS values to be configured. | 4.0 | A well-structured intent whose credibility is undermined by an inconsistent and unrealistic performance target for a mission-critical context. |
| 38 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 77 processing cores and 453GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The modification of compute resources (cores, memory) and performance constraints (timeout) is a standard operation in a virtualized environment. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple resource parameters (cores, memory, timeout), making it a detailed modification request. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated with specific values, making it easy to parse and act upon. | 5 | The description clearly defines a modification to existing resources, aligning with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links the resource adjustment to the goal of optimizing performance and cost. | 5 | The specified parameters are independent and consistent with each other for a resource scaling operation. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary parameters (cores, memory, timeout) for the resource adjustment. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and actionable intent for resource modification. |

| 41 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Massive_MIMO_32T32R antenna systems with high-priority Horizontal_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 55Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 4 | Massive MIMO 32T32R is a standard configuration. However, "Horizontal_Beamforming" is not a standard term (usually 2D/3D). 55Gbps backhaul is very high but plausible for a Massive MIMO site. | 4 | The intent combines modifications to the antenna system, beamforming technique, and backhaul capacity. | 4 | The intent is mostly readable, but the term "Horizontal_Beamforming" is non-standard and could cause confusion. | 5 | The description is a clear request to reconfigure network elements, matching the intent type. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the non-standard terminology slightly impairs coherence. | 4 | The technical components are mostly consistent, with the exception of the non-standard beamforming term. | 4 | The intent specifies what to reconfigure and what the desired enhancements are. | 4.1 | A good intent with a clear goal, slightly weakened by the use of non-standard terminology for beamforming. |
| 42 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-4442-7695] | 4 | 5G-AKA is standard. 256-NEA2 is non-standard; 3GPP specifies 128-bit NEA algorithms (NEA1, NEA2, NEA3). While 256-bit algorithms exist (e.g., for SUCI), the naming is incorrect. | 4 | It specifies authentication and encryption algorithms as part of a performance assurance goal. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and states a common goal: enabling security without performance degradation. | 4 | The description is about security configuration as a means of assurance, making it moderately relevant to the "performance assurance" type. | 5 | The logic is clear: implement security measures while maintaining performance. | 3 | The reference to "256_NEA2" appears to be non-standard, which is a significant consistency issue. | 4 | The intent specifies the security mechanisms and the overarching performance constraint. | 4.1 | A well-written intent with a clear goal, but it is technically flawed due to the use of a non-standard encryption algorithm name. |

| 45 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with high-priority 3 x86_64 cores and 12GB DDR4 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Provisioning compute resources with specific CPU and memory types is a fundamental cloud/NFV operation. | 3 | The intent is simple, specifying only CPU cores and memory. It lacks context about the network function. | 5 | The request is very clear, direct, and easy to parse. | 5 | The description is a straightforward provisioning request, which is a type of deployment intent. | 5 | The structure is simple and logical. | 4 | The resources are described as "high-performance" but the specs (3 cores, 12GB DDR4) are modest. This is a minor inconsistency in tone but not a technical contradiction. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it does not specify which network function the resources are for. | 4.3 | A simple and clear resource provisioning intent, but it lacks the necessary context of the target workload. |
| 46 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with 110 RISC_V processing cores at 3.65GHz considering computational requirements and performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G Core NF.

| 47 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA1 security breaches with mission-critical 16hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA authentication and 128-NEA1 encryption are valid 3GPP security mechanisms (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple security event triggers for a single notification rule. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the connection between the different triggers ("failures or breaches with key rotation") is ambiguous. | 5 | The description is a request for an alert, which matches the intent type. | 3 | The logic is slightly disjointed. It's unclear if key rotation is a trigger itself or just context for the other triggers. A clearer structure would be "Alert on X, alert on Y, and notify on Z". | 5 | The security mechanisms themselves are standard and consistent. | 4 | It specifies the events to monitor and requests notification, but the relationship between the events is not perfectly clear. | 4.3 | A good intent specifying valid security events, but its structure could be clearer to avoid ambiguity in the trigger logic. |
| 48 | Performance Assurance Intent | Implement high-performance networking achieving 1000Mbps high-throughput high-capacity and 5ms ultra-low latency through CPU_BASED intelligent scaling mechanisms. [Instance-4448-7724] | 5 | The KPIs (throughput, latency) and method (CPU-based scaling) are standard concepts in performance management. | 4 | The intent specifies target KPIs and a scaling methodology. | 4 | The phrase "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant, but the overall intent is clear. | 5 | The description outlines a goal for implementing and assuring performance, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: achieve performance goals using a specified method. | 5 | The goals of high throughput and low latency are consistent with high-performance networking. | 4 | The intent provides clear targets but lacks context on the specific service or application. | 4.6 | A good, clear intent for performance assurance, with only minor redundancy in its phrasing. |
| 49 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 68 processing cores and 137GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The modification of compute resources (cores, memory) and performance constraints (timeout) is a standard operation in a virtualized environment. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple resource parameters (cores, memory, timeout), making it a detailed modification request. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated with specific values, making it easy to parse and act upon. | 5 | The description clearly defines a modification to existing resources, aligning with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links the resource adjustment to the goal of optimizing performance and cost. | 5 | The specified parameters are independent and consistent with each other for a resource scaling operation. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary parameters (cores, memory, timeout) for the resource adjustment. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and actionable intent for resource modification. |

[Instance-4450-7742] | 5 | The KPIs (throughput, latency) and method (CPU-based scaling) are standard concepts in performance management. | 4 | The intent specifies target KPIs and a scaling methodology. | 4 | The phrase "high-throughput high-capacity" is redundant, but the overall intent is clear. | 5 | The description outlines a goal for implementing and assuring performance, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: achieve performance goals using a specified method. | 5 | The goals of high throughput and low latency are consistent with high-performance networking. | 4 | The intent provides clear targets but lacks context on the specific service or application. | 4.6 | A good, clear intent for performance assurance, with only minor redundancy in its phrasing. This is a duplicate of a previous record. |
| 51 | Deployment Intent | "Execute mission-critical massive machine-type communications supporting IoT ecosystems deployment with Non_Standalone_5G network architecture and Massive_MIMO_32T32R MIMO antenna systems, ensuring ultra-reliable massive connectivity for critical applications." | 4 | The intent mixes concepts: mMTC is for massive connectivity, while "ultra-reliable" and "critical applications" point to URLLC. NSA is a valid architecture, and Massive MIMO is a valid technology. | 5 | The intent is complex, specifying service type (mMTC), architecture (NSA), RAN technology (Massive MIMO), and a reliability requirement. | 4 | The language is clear and well-structured. | 5 | This is a clear request to deploy a service, matching the intent type. | 5 | The components of the deployment are described logically. | 3 | There is an inconsistency between the service type (mMTC, for massive numbers of low-power devices) and the requirements ("ultra-reliable," "critical applications"), which are hallmarks of URLLC. A hybrid service is possible but not explicitly stated. | 5 | The intent provides a good level of detail on the desired deployment. | 4.4 | A well-written intent that combines potentially conflicting service characteristics (mMTC and URLLC) without clarification. |
| 52 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-performance infrastructure using 5G_AKA authentication frameworks and 128_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising performance characteristics. [Instance-4452-7764] | 5 | 5G-AKA and 128-NEA2 are standard 3GPP security mechanisms. The goal of enabling security without impacting performance is a key assurance task. | 4 | It specifies authentication and encryption algorithms as part of a performance assurance goal. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased and states a common and important goal. | 4 | The description is about security configuration as a means of assurance, making it moderately relevant to the "performance assurance" type. | 5 | The logic is clear: implement security measures while maintaining performance. | 5 | The specified security mechanisms are standard and consistent with a modern 5G deployment. | 4 | The intent specifies the security mechanisms and the overarching performance constraint. | 4.6 | A clear and technically correct intent that appropriately links security configuration to performance assurance. |
| 53 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 44GB LPDDR5 memory and 4308GB SATA_SSD storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 4 | LPDDR5 is low-power memory, typically for mobile or edge devices, while SATA SSD is a lower-performance storage. The pairing is plausible for an edge use case. The phrasing "requirements for" is slightly backward. | 4 | The intent specifies specific memory and storage types and requires a performance impact analysis. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly awkward ("requirements for 44GB..."), but the core request is understandable. | 5 | The description is a request for an evaluation/check, which aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, despite the slightly awkward phrasing. | 4 | The pairing of low-power RAM with bulk SATA storage is a consistent choice for certain types of edge or storage-heavy applications. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function or service the hardware is for. | 4.0 | A moderately well-formed intent that is weakened by a lack of workload context. |
| 54 | Intent Report Request | Generate comprehensive AMF performance analytics report analyzing 44 core utilization and 152GB memory consumption patterns with detailed resource optimization recommendations. | 5 | Requesting a performance report on a specific NF (AMF) focusing on CPU and memory utilization is a standard and crucial OAM task. | 4 | The intent specifies the NF, the exact metrics to analyze, and asks for recommendations, making it a detailed reporting request. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and uses standard terminology. | 5 | The description is a direct request for a report, aligning perfectly with the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: generate a report on specific metrics for a specific NF and include recommendations. | 5 | The request to analyze core and memory usage for an AMF is a perfectly consistent and valid operational requirement. | 5 | The intent is complete, specifying the NF, the metrics, and the desired output (report with recommendations). | 4.9 | An excellent, clear, and practical intent for network function performance analysis and optimization. |

| 56 | Performance Assurance Intent | "Configure 101ms packet delay budget with mission-critical 0.003835 error rate tolerance, implementing sophisticated traffic engineering and quality assurance mechanisms." | 5 | Packet Delay Budget and Packet Error Rate are standard 5G QoS Indicators (5QI) used to define service quality. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct QoS parameters (delay, error rate) for configuration. | 5 | The intent is clearly phrased with specific, valid QoS parameters. | 5 | The description is a configuration request aimed at assuring performance, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: configure parameter A and parameter B using specified mechanisms. | 5 | A 101ms delay budget is consistent with services like real-time gaming or some interactive applications, and pairing it with an error rate is standard practice. | 4 | The intent provides the specific QoS values to be configured. | 4.7 | A clear, correct, and actionable intent for configuring QoS parameters. |
| 57 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 262Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with 40.88ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 5 | Analyzing the feasibility of delivering a specific bitrate and latency is a core task in network planning and service admission control. | 4 | The intent specifies two key performance metrics and the context for analysis (topology, traffic). | 4 | "Ultra-low latency" is a qualitative term, while a specific value (40.88ms) is given. While 40ms is low, it's not "ultra-low" in the context of URLLC (which targets <1-5ms). This is a minor terminological clash. | 5 | The description is a request for a feasibility analysis, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical and clear. | 4 | The use of "ultra-low latency" to describe a ~41ms requirement is slightly inconsistent with the stricter 3GPP definition for URLLC, but it's a common colloquial misuse. | 4 | The intent provides the target KPIs but lacks context about the service or location. | 4.4 | A good and practical feasibility intent, with a minor issue in the use of the term "ultra-low latency." |
| 58 | Deployment Intent | Provision high-performance compute resources with 3 ARM64 cores and 26GB DDR5 memory for demanding network functions. | 5 | Provisioning compute resources with a specific architecture (ARM64) and memory type (DDR5) is a fundamental cloud/NFV operation. | 3 | The intent is simple, specifying only CPU cores and memory. It lacks context about the network function. | 5 | The request is very clear, direct, and easy to parse. | 5 | The description is a straightforward provisioning request, which is a type of deployment intent. | 5 | The structure is simple and logical. | 5 | The resources (ARM64, DDR5) are consistent with modern, efficient compute infrastructure. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it does not specify which network function the resources are for. | 4.4 | A simple and clear resource provisioning intent, but it lacks the necessary context of the target workload. |
| 59 | Modification Intent | Modify core network 34 processing cores and 75GB memory allocation with transport network optimization. | 4 | The intent combines resource modification in the core network with a high-level goal for the transport network. This is slightly unusual as they are often managed separately. | 4 | It specifies compute resource changes and a related but separate optimization goal. | 3 | The intent is ambiguous. It's unclear what "with transport network optimization" means. Is it a precondition? A simultaneous action? The outcome? | 5 | The description is a request for modification, matching the intent type. | 2 | The link between adjusting core compute resources and "transport network optimization" is not coherently explained, making the intent confusing. | 3 | The two parts of the intent are not necessarily consistent. A change in compute resources for NFs doesn't automatically imply or require a transport network optimization. | 3 | The intent is incomplete because the "transport network optimization" part is vague and lacks any specific parameters or goals. | 3.4 | A confusing and poorly structured intent that combines a specific resource modification with a vague, unrelated goal. |
| 60 | Intent Feasibility Check | Analyze 46Mbps bitrate delivery feasibility with mission-critical 40.36ms ultra-low latency constraints considering network topology and traffic patterns. | 5 | Analyzing the feasibility of delivering a specific bitrate and latency is a core task in network planning. | 4 | The intent specifies two key performance metrics and the context for analysis. | 4 | As before, calling ~40ms "ultra-low latency" is a terminological clash with the strict URLLC definition, though it's low for many applications. "Mission-critical" is also a strong word for these KPIs. | 5 | The description is a request for a feasibility analysis, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical and clear. | 3 | The combination of "mission-critical" and "ultra-low latency" with a modest 46Mbps bitrate and a ~40ms delay is inconsistent. Mission-critical URLLC usually has much stricter latency targets. | 4 | The intent provides the target KPIs but lacks context about the specific service. | 4.1 | A practical feasibility intent that suffers from an inconsistent use of qualifiers ("mission-critical", "ultra-low latency") for the given performance targets. |
| 61 | Performance Assurance Intent | Secure high-deterministic performance infrastructure using Certificate_Based authentication frameworks and 256_NEA2 encryption protocols without compromising deterministic performance characteristics. | 4 | Certificate-based auth is valid.

A clearer structure would be "Alert on X, alert on Y, and notify on Z". | 5 | The security mechanisms themselves are standard and consistent. | 4 | It specifies the events to monitor and requests notification, but the relationship between the events is not perfectly clear. | 4.3 | A good intent specifying valid security events, but its structure could be clearer to avoid ambiguity in the trigger logic. |

It likely means "deterministic throughput," but it could be clearer. | 5 | The description is a clear request for an alert, matching the intent type. | 5 | The logic is clear: IF (performance metric A or B is breached) THEN (escalate). | 5 | The KPIs of high throughput and low latency are often monitored together for high-performance services, making the request consistent. | 5 | The intent completely defines the notification trigger (KPIs and thresholds) and the action (automated escalation). | 4.7 | A strong, practical intent for performance monitoring, with a minor awkwardness in phrasing. |
| 95 | Modification Intent | "Adjust compute resources to 109 processing cores and 100GB memory allocation with 1800seconds execution timeout constraints, optimizing performance while maintaining cost efficiency." | 5 | The modification of compute resources (cores, memory) and performance constraints (timeout) is a standard operation in a virtualized environment. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple resource parameters (cores, memory, timeout), making it a detailed modification request. | 5 | The request is clearly articulated with specific values, making it easy to parse and act upon. | 5 | The description clearly defines a modification to existing resources, aligning with the intent type. | 5 | The intent logically links the resource adjustment to the goal of optimizing performance and cost. | 5 | The specified parameters are independent and consistent with each other for a resource scaling operation. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary parameters (cores, memory, timeout) for the resource adjustment. | 4.9 | A clear, complete, and actionable intent for resource modification. |
| 96 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Beamforming_8T8R antenna systems with high-priority 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 19Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 4 | 8T8R and 3D Beamforming are standard RAN concepts. "Beamforming_8T8R" is a slightly non-standard way to name an antenna system. | 4 | The intent combines modifications to the antenna system, beamforming technique, and backhaul capacity. | 4 | The intent is readable, although the antenna system naming is unconventional. | 5 | The description is a clear request to reconfigure network elements, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, linking the reconfigurations to the goal of improving performance. | 5 | The components are consistent: 8T8R antennas support 3D beamforming, and a 19Gbps backhaul is a reasonable capacity for such a site. | 4 | The intent specifies what to reconfigure and what the desired enhancements are. | 4.4 | A good, technically sound intent for RAN modification, with a minor issue in terminology. |
| 97 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 175GB HBM2 memory and 3513GB Optane storage with performance impact analysis. | 4 | HBM2 and Optane are both very high-performance technologies, making them a consistent pairing. The phrasing "requirements for" is still slightly backward. | 4 | The intent specifies advanced hardware types and requires a performance impact analysis. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly awkward ("requirements for 175GB..."), but the core request is understandable. | 5 | The description is a request for an evaluation/check, which aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, despite the slightly awkward phrasing. | 5 | The pairing of high-performance HBM2 memory and high-performance Optane storage is consistent. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function or service the hardware is for. | 4.1 | A good intent specifying a consistent set of high-performance hardware, but it lacks workload context, making the feasibility check difficult. |
| 98 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with mission-critical Vertical_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 36Gbps backhaul capacity enhancement, improving coverage and deterministic performance." | 4 | 4T4R MIMO is standard. "Vertical_Beamforming" is not a standard term; it's a component of 3D beamforming. The 36Gbps backhaul capacity is very high for a 4T4R system. | 4 | The intent combines modifications to the antenna system, beamforming technique, and backhaul capacity. | 4 | The intent is readable, but "Vertical_Beamforming" is non-standard terminology. | 5 | The description is a clear request to reconfigure network elements, matching the intent type. | 4 | The structure is logical, but the non-standard terminology slightly impairs coherence. | 2 | The massive 36Gbps backhaul capacity is inconsistent with a relatively simple 4T4R antenna system. This level of backhaul would typically support Massive MIMO arrays. The beamforming term is also non-standard. | 4 | The intent specifies what to reconfigure and what the desired enhancements are. | 3.9 | An intent with a clear goal that suffers from non-standard terminology and a significant inconsistency between the antenna system and backhaul capacity. |
| 99 | Performance Assurance Intent | Optimize performance achieving 455ms response time with mission-critical predictive analytics and automated remediation capabilities. | 4 | A 455ms response time is very high and would not be considered "optimized performance" for most real-time services. The other concepts are valid. | 4 | The intent specifies a target KPI, a priority, and the methods to be used. | 4 | The intent is clearly phrased, but the target response time is unusually high for a performance optimization goal, especially a "mission-critical" one. | 5 | The description outlines a goal for performance assurance and optimization, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical: achieve KPI target using specified advanced methods. | 2 | The stated goal of "optimizing performance" for a "mission-critical" purpose is inconsistent with the very high target response time of 455ms. | 4 | The intent specifies the target metric, the value, and the methods, but lacks context on the service being optimized. | 4.0 | A well-structured intent whose credibility is undermined by an inconsistent and unrealistic performance target. |
| 100 | Deployment Intent | "Monitor security events using Isolation_Forest behavioral anomaly detection with 5minutes/11minutes/43minutes escalation policies, ensuring rapid response to security incidents." | 5 | Using AI/ML models like Isolation Forest for security monitoring is a modern and valid approach. Defining timed escalation policies is standard practice in incident response. | 4 | The intent specifies the monitoring technique, the model, and a multi-tiered escalation policy. | 5 | The request is clear, specific, and well-structured. | 4 | This is more of a monitoring or assurance intent than a deployment intent. It describes configuring a monitoring system, not deploying a new service. | 5 | The structure is logical, defining the monitoring method and the response action. | 5 | The use of anomaly detection with tiered escalation policies is a consistent and effective security monitoring strategy. | 5 | The intent provides a complete description of the monitoring and escalation rule. | 4.7 | A very good, clear, and practical intent for security monitoring, though it might be better classified as a "Regular Notification" or "Performance Assurance" intent. |
| 101 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 499GB LPDDR5 memory and 8482GB NVMe_PCIe4 storage with high-priority performance impact analysis. | 4 | LPDDR5 is low-power RAM, while NVMe PCIe4 is very high-performance storage. This is a slightly unusual but plausible pairing for an I/O-heavy edge device. The "requirements for" phrasing is still awkward. | 4 | The intent specifies specific memory and storage types and requires a performance impact analysis. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly awkward ("requirements for 499GB..."), but the core request is understandable. | 5 | The description is a request for an evaluation/check, which aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, despite the slightly awkward phrasing. | 4 | The pairing is plausible for specific workloads (e.g., data ingestion at the edge) that are I/O bound but also need power efficiency. | 3 | The intent is incomplete as it doesn't specify which network function or service the hardware is for. | 4.0 | A moderately well-formed intent that is weakened by a lack of workload context. |

| 105 | Deployment Intent | "Implement advanced 6_Sector antenna sectorization optimized for Indoor_Hotspot deployment scenarios, maximizing spectral efficiency and user experience quality." | 5 | Antenna sectorization is a fundamental RAN design principle. 6-sector configurations are used in high-density scenarios, which is consistent with "Indoor_Hotspot". | 4 | The intent specifies the sectorization configuration, the deployment scenario, and the optimization goals. | 5 | The language is clear, precise, and uses standard RAN engineering terminology. | 5 | This is a clear request to implement a specific RAN configuration, which is a type of deployment intent. | 5 | The intent logically connects the technical configuration (6-sector) to the scenario and goals. | 5 | Using 6-sector antennas in an indoor hotspot to maximize spectral efficiency is a consistent and valid RAN design strategy. | 5 | The intent provides a complete description of the desired RAN configuration and its purpose. | 4.9 | An excellent, practical, and well-formed intent for RAN design and optimization. |
| 106 | Modification Intent | "Reconfigure Traditional_MIMO_4T4R antenna systems with 3D_Beamforming beamforming optimization and 97Gbps backhaul high-capacity enhancement, improving coverage and performance." | 4 | 4T4R MIMO and 3D Beamforming are standard concepts. However, the 97Gbps backhaul capacity is extremely high and inconsistent with a "Traditional_MIMO_4T4R" system. | 4 | The intent combines modifications to the antenna system, beamforming technique, and backhaul capacity. | 5 | The intent is readable and uses standard terminology. | 5 | The description is a clear request to reconfigure network elements, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, linking the reconfigurations to the goal of improving performance. | 2 | The massive 97Gbps backhaul capacity is fundamentally inconsistent with a relatively simple 4T4R antenna system.

| 107 | Intent Feasibility Check | Evaluate memory and storage requirements for 340GB DDR5 memory and 5723GB SATA_SSD storage with mission-critical performance impact analysis. | 4 | DDR5 is high-performance memory, while SATA SSD is a lower-performance storage technology. The combination is slightly unusual for a "mission-critical" system. The "requirements for" phrasing is also awkward. | 4 | The intent specifies memory and storage types and requires a performance impact analysis. | 4 | The phrasing is slightly awkward ("requirements for 340GB..."), but the core request is understandable. | 5 | The description is a request for an evaluation/check, which aligns with the intent type. | 4 | The structure is mostly logical, despite the slightly awkward phrasing. | 3 | For a "mission-critical" system, pairing high-speed DDR5 memory with slower SATA SSD storage is an inconsistent choice.

| 109 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on 5G_AKA authentication failures or 128_NEA3 security breaches with mission-critical 13hours key rotation event notifications. | 5 | 5G-AKA authentication and 128-NEA3 encryption are valid 3GPP security mechanisms (TS 33.501). | 4 | The intent specifies multiple security event triggers for a single notification rule. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the connection between the different triggers ("failures or breaches with key rotation") is ambiguous. | 5 | The description is a request for an alert, which matches the intent type. | 3 | The logic is slightly disjointed. It's unclear if key rotation is a trigger itself or just context for the other triggers. A clearer structure would be "Alert on X, alert on Y, and notify on Z". | 5 | The security mechanisms themselves are standard and consistent. | 4 | It specifies the events to monitor and requests notification, but the relationship between the events is not perfectly clear. | 4.3 | A good intent specifying valid security events, but its structure could be clearer to avoid ambiguity in the trigger logic. |
| 110 | Regular Notification Request | Alert on Certificate_Based authentication failures or 256_NEA1 security breaches with high-priority 24hours key rotation event notifications. | 4 | Certificate-based auth is valid. "256_NEA1" is not a standard 3GPP algorithm name. The bundling of triggers is ambiguous. | 4 | The intent specifies multiple security triggers for a notification rule. | 4 | The intent is readable, but the connection between authentication/breach alerts and "key rotation event notifications" is unclear. | 5 | The description requests an alert, matching the intent type. | 3 | The logic is disjointed. It's unclear if key rotation is a third trigger or just contextual information. | 3 | The reference to "256_NEA1" appears to be non-standard, which is a significant consistency issue. | 4 | It specifies the events to monitor, but the ambiguous structure and non-standard term are problematic. | 3.9 | An intent with valid concepts but flawed by a non-standard technical term and an ambiguous logical structure. |

Most applications would be memory-starved. | 5 | The intent provides all necessary parameters (cores, memory, timeout) for the resource adjustment. | 4.7 | A well-formed intent that is likely non-viable due to a highly imbalanced and unrealistic CPU-to-memory ratio. |
| 113 | Intent Feasibility Check | Assess AMF deployment feasibility with mission-critical 79 RISC_V processing cores at 1.67GHz considering computational requirements and deterministic performance constraints. | 5 | AMF is a standard 5G Core NF.

| 116 | Modification Intent | "Adjust network high-capacity to 4550Mbps broadband allocation and 988146_devices_per_km2 connection density requirements, accommodating growing user demands and traffic patterns." | 4 | The intent modifies high-level network capacity parameters. However, "broadband allocation" is vague. The connection density is extremely high, characteristic of mMTC. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct and demanding network-wide KPIs. | 4 | The language is slightly imprecise ("network high-capacity," "broadband allocation"), but the general meaning is clear. | 5 | The description requests an adjustment to network parameters, matching the intent type. | 5 | The structure is logical, stating the desired changes and the reason. | 4 | The two KPIs (high broadband throughput per user and massive device density) cater to different service types (eMBB and mMTC). While a network must support both, stating them as a single adjustment target can be inconsistent. | 4 | The intent provides target values but lacks detail on how or where these adjustments should be implemented. | 4.3 | A high-level policy intent that is reasonable but could be more specific and might be targeting conflicting service requirements simultaneously. |

[Instance-4580-8643] | 5 | Monitoring throughput and latency are fundamental aspects of Service Level Agreement (SLA) assurance, fully aligned with 3GPP OAM principles. | 4 | The intent specifies two distinct performance KPIs (throughput, latency) and an action (escalation), making it a comprehensive notification rule. | 5 | The intent is clear, concise, and uses standard performance metrics, making it perfectly readable. | 5 | The description is a clear request for an alert, matching the intent type. | 5 | The logic is clear: IF (performance metric A or B is breached) THEN (escalate). | 5 | The KPIs of high throughput and low latency are often monitored together for high-performance services, making the request consistent. | 5 | The intent completely defines the notification trigger (KPIs and thresholds) and the action (automated escalation). | 4.9 | An excellent, practical, and well-formed intent for performance monitoring and assurance. |

A "medium priority" service is unlikely to support "mission-critical applications." More importantly, a "strict 3.25ms packet delay budget" is a demanding URLLC requirement, inconsistent with "medium priority" and a low 6Mbps bitrate. | 5 | The intent provides the specific performance indicators for the service. | 4.0 | A well-structured intent that is completely invalidated by severe and fundamental contradictions between its parameters. |
