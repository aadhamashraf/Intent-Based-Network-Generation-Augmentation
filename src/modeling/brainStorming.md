# **Modeling Tasks**

## 1. **Intent Classification and Taxonomy Building**
* Automatically recognize and categorize the wide variety of network intents (e.g., performance assurance, security config, latency tuning) using natural language inputs and metadata—enabling automation and analytics.*

## 2. **SLA Compliance and Breach Prediction**
* Predict, classify, and forecast SLA violations based on real-time and historical KPI, resource, and context data—empowering proactive assurance and customer satisfaction.*

## 3. **Network Performance & Anomaly Detection**
* Automatically identify abnormal conditions or emerging issues in large volumes of telemetry (latency, jitter, error rates, throughput, mobility metrics, etc.), supporting rapid remediation and RCA (root-cause analysis).*

## 4. **Automated Assurance Action Optimization**
* Model and optimize which proactive or reactive network actions (like predictive scaling, rerouting, resource tuning) deliver the best outcome for resolving or preventing issues.*

## 5. **Intent–KPI Impact Analysis**
* Quantify how specific intents (e.g., changing resource priorities, tuning security protocols) affect target KPIs—helping operators and systems to prioritize high-impact changes.*

## 6. **Multi-Domain Service Orchestration Modeling**
* Simulate or optimize how network resources and assurance policies are coordinated across distributed domains (sites, clouds, slices), maximizing reliability and efficiency.*

## 7. **Alert Prioritization and Triage**
* Learn which alerts or conditions merit the quickest/operator attention, minimizing noise and focusing on high-severity/high-risk network events.*

## 8. **Security/Privacy Intent Enforcement Analysis**
* Model the reliability and effectiveness of security- or privacy-driven intents in enforcing required policy under real-world conditions.*

## 9. **Intent Quality Assessment & Drift Detection**
* Detect when intents are ambiguous, conflicting, or “drifting” in meaning/structure over time, crucial for maintaining robust automation as vocabularies and network contexts evolve.*

## 10. **Resource Allocation & Optimization Simulation**
* Predict and optimize how compute, bandwidth, and virtualization changes driven by intents will affect overall network and application performance.*
